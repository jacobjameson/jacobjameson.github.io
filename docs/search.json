    "text": "“There is certainly no unanimity on exactly what centrality is or on its conceptual foundations, and there is little agreement on the proper procedure for its measurement.” - Linton Freeman (1977)\nSocial network analysis can be used to measure the importance of a person as a function of the social structure of a community or organization. This post uses visualization as a tool to explain how different measures of centrality may be used to analyze different questions in a network analysis. In these examples we will be specifically looking at directed graphs to compare the following centrality measures and their use-cases:\n\nDegree Centrality\nBetweenness Centrality\nEigenvector Centrality\nKatz Centrality\nHITS Hubs and Authorities\n\nAn example of a directed graph would be one in which people nominate their top 2 friends. In this graph, nodes (people) would connect to others nodes through directed edges (nominations). It is possible for Jacob to nominate Jenna without Jenna nominating him back. You can imagine why centrality in a friendship network might take into account the direction of these nominations. If I list 100 people as my friends and none of them list me back, do we think I am a popular person?"

When we sum up all connections of a node, not all neighbors are equally important. This is a very interesting way to measure popularity in our classroom where we say the popularity of your friends matters more than the number of friends. Let’s consider two nodes in a friend network with same degree, the one who is connected to more central nodes should be more central.\nFirst, we define an initial guess for the centrality of nodes in a graph as \\(x_i=1\\). Now we are going to iterate for the new centrality value \\(x_i'\\) for node \\(i\\) as following:\n\\[x_i' = \\sum_{j} A_{ij}x_j\\]\nHere \\(A_{ij}\\) is an element of the adjacency matrix, where it gives 1 or 0 for whether an edge exists between nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). it can also be written in matrix notation as \\(\\mathbf{x'} = \\mathbf{Ax}\\).\nWe iterate over t steps to find the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\) as:\n\\[\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{A^t x}(0)\\]\n\npar(bg=\"grey98\")\nplot(network, layout=lay, \n     vertex.label.dist=1.5, vertex.label.color = \"black\", edge.color=\"grey80\",\n     vertex.size=evcent(network)$vector*15,   # Rescaled by multiplying by 15\n     main=\"Eigenvector Centrality\", vertex.color=\"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows, the students which have the same number of friend nominations are not necessarily in the same size. The one that is connected to more central, or “popular” nodes are larger in this visualization.\nHowever, as we can see from the definition, this can be a problematic measure for directed graphs. Let’s say that a student who received no friend nominations themselves nominates another student as a friend. Because that person has 0 friend nominations themselves, they would not contribute any importance to the person they nominated. In other words, eigenvector centrality would not take zero in-degree nodes into account in directed graphs.\nHowever there is a solution to this!"

In order to find out such nodes, the HITS algorithm introduces two types of central nodes: Hubs and Authorities. For Hubs, we might consider a node important if it links to many highly nominated nodes (i.e. the person nominates many popular people as their friends). For Authorities, we might consider a node to be of importance if many highly nominated nodes link to it (i.e. nominated by many popular people).\nAuthority Centrality is defined as the sum of the hub centralities which point to the node (i):\n\\[x_i = \\alpha \\sum_{j} A_{ij} y_j,\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is constant. Likewise, Hub Centrality is the sum of the authorities which are pointed by the node \\(i\\):\n\\[y_i = \\beta \\sum_{j} A_{ji} x_j,\\]\nwith constant \\(\\beta\\). Here notice that the element of the adjacency matrix are swapped for Hub Centrality because we are concerned with outgoing edges for hubs. So in matrix notation:\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = \\alpha \\mathbf{Ay}, \\quad\\]\n\\[\\mathbf{y} = \\beta \\mathbf{A^Tx}.\\] As it can be seen from the drawing, HITS Algorithm also tackles the problem with zero in-degree nodes of Eigenvector Centrality. These zero in-degree nodes become central hubs and contribute to other nodes. Yet we can still use a free centrality contribution constant like in Katz Centrality or other variants.\nAlthough these measures are generally used in a citation network or the internet, this can be pretty interesting in the context of our classroom frienship network. Maybe we are interested in knowing who are the non-popular students that nominate many popular students as friends, but receive no reciprocity in terms of nominations."

    "text": "“There is certainly no unanimity on exactly what centrality is or on its conceptual foundations, and there is little agreement on the proper procedure for its measurement.” - Linton Freeman (1977)\nSocial network analysis can be used to measure the importance of a person as a function of the social structure of a community or organization. This post uses visualization as a tool to explain how different measures of centrality may be used to analyze different questions in a network analysis. In these examples we will be specifically looking at directed graphs to compare the following centrality measures and their use-cases:\n\nDegree Centrality\nBetweenness Centrality\nEigenvector Centrality\nKatz Centrality\nHITS Hubs and Authorities\n\nAn example of a directed graph would be one in which people nominate their top 2 friends. In this graph, nodes (people) would connect to others nodes through directed edges (nominations). It is possible for Jacob to nominate Jenna without Jenna nominating him back. You can imagine why centrality in a friendship network might take into account the direction of these nominations. If I list 100 people as my friends and none of them list me back, do we think I am a popular person?"

    "text": "Creating a Graphing Object\nThere are many available centrality measures that have been developed for network analysis. At this time, there are no packages that are so comprehensive that it includes all of the measures. I will, therefore, limit this discussion to a subset of the measures that are included in igraph.\nigraph has a really great function that allows us to turn a dataframe into an igraph object. However, the function requires our data to be in “long” form so we will need to do some reshaping. Let’s restructure our data such that each row represents one directed friend nomination. We are going to call this “Source-Target Form”.\n\nlibrary(reshape) \n\nfriendships <- melt(simulate.top.friends(males,females,probs.diff.sex, probs.same.sex), \n                    id=c(\"Ego\", \"Ego Sex\")) %>%\n  select(source=Ego, source_sex =`Ego Sex`, target=value) %>% \n  arrange(source)\n\nLet’s look at the first 10 observations so we can understand the format needed to turn this data into an igraph object.\n\nhead(friendships, 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    source \n    source_sex \n    target \n  \n \n\n  \n    Allyssa \n    Female \n    David \n  \n  \n    Allyssa \n    Female \n    Nolan \n  \n  \n    Allyssa \n    Female \n    Jenna \n  \n  \n    Allyssa \n    Female \n    Towo \n  \n  \n    Avery \n    Male \n    John \n  \n  \n    Avery \n    Male \n    Chris \n  \n  \n    Avery \n    Male \n    Allyssa \n  \n  \n    Avery \n    Male \n    Meredith \n  \n  \n    Becca \n    Female \n    Chris \n  \n  \n    Becca \n    Female \n    Wyatt \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the graph_from_data_frame function to create the igraph object.\n\nlibrary(igraph)\nnetwork <- graph_from_data_frame(friendships[,c('source','target','source_sex')],\n                                 directed = TRUE)\n\nnetwork\n\nIGRAPH bedd467 DN-- 28 112 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c), source_sex (e/c)\n+ edges from bedd467 (vertex names):\n [1] Allyssa->David    Allyssa->Nolan    Allyssa->Jenna    Allyssa->Towo    \n [5] Avery  ->John     Avery  ->Chris    Avery  ->Allyssa  Avery  ->Meredith\n [9] Becca  ->Chris    Becca  ->Wyatt    Becca  ->Jade     Becca  ->Jenna   \n[13] Bob    ->Dylan    Bob    ->David    Bob    ->Marlene  Bob    ->Wendy   \n[17] Bohan  ->Nolan    Bohan  ->John     Bohan  ->Katarina Bohan  ->Reigne  \n[21] Chris  ->Jacob    Chris  ->Avery    Chris  ->Bohan    Chris  ->Allyssa \n[25] Dallas ->Louis    Dallas ->Robert   Dallas ->Jenna    Dallas ->Towo    \n[29] David  ->Zach     David  ->Dallas   David  ->Bohan    David  ->Jenna   \n+ ... omitted several edges\n\n\nLet’s better understand the information contained in an igraph object:\n\nIGRAPH simply annotates network as an igraph object\nWhatever random six digit alphanumeric string follows IGRAPH is simply how igraph identifies the graph for itself, it’s not important for our purposes.\nD would tell us that it is directed graph\nN indicates that network is a named graph, in that the vertices have a name attribute\n– refers to attributes not applicable to network, but we will see them in the future:\n28 refers to the number of vertices in network\n112 refers to the number of edges in network\nattr: is a list of attributes within the graph.\n(v/c), which will appear following name, tells us that it is a vertex attribute of a character data type.\n(e/c) or (e/n) referring to edge attributes that are of character or numeric data types\n\nedges from arbitrary igraph name (vertex names): lists a sample of network’s edges using the names of the vertices which they connect.\n\n\nNow let’s create a rough plot to look at our network!\n\nlay <- layout_with_kk(network)\n\npar(bg=\"grey98\")\nplot(network, layout = lay, edge.color=\"grey80\",\n     vertex.color=\"lightblue\", vertex.label.color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the rest of this post, we are going to talk about a few different measures of centrality, what they capture mathematically and intuitively, and we will look at plots where the size of the node corresponds to the relative centrality score."

When we sum up all connections of a node, not all neighbors are equally important. This is a very interesting way to measure popularity in our classroom where we say the popularity of your friends matters more than the number of friends. Let’s consider two nodes in a friend network with same degree, the one who is connected to more central nodes should be more central.\nFirst, we define an initial guess for the centrality of nodes in a graph as \\(x_i=1\\). Now we are going to iterate for the new centrality value \\(x_i'\\) for node \\(i\\) as following:\n\\[x_i' = \\sum_{j} A_{ij}x_j\\]\nHere \\(A_{ij}\\) is an element of the adjacency matrix, where it gives 1 or 0 for whether an edge exists between nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). it can also be written in matrix notation as \\(\\mathbf{x'} = \\mathbf{Ax}\\).\nWe iterate over t steps to find the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\) as:\n\\[\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{A^t x}(0)\\]\n\npar(bg=\"grey98\")\nplot(network, layout=lay, \n     vertex.label.dist=1.5, vertex.label.color = \"black\", edge.color=\"grey80\",\n     vertex.size=evcent(network)$vector*15,   # Rescaled by multiplying by 15\n     main=\"Eigenvector Centrality\", vertex.color=\"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows, the students which have the same number of friend nominations are not necessarily in the same size. The one that is connected to more central, or “popular” nodes are larger in this visualization.\nHowever, as we can see from the definition, this can be a problematic measure for directed graphs. Let’s say that a student who received no friend nominations themselves nominates another student as a friend. Because that person has 0 friend nominations themselves, they would not contribute any importance to the person they nominated. In other words, eigenvector centrality would not take zero in-degree nodes into account in directed graphs.\nHowever there is a solution to this!"

In order to find out such nodes, the HITS algorithm introduces two types of central nodes: Hubs and Authorities. For Hubs, we might consider a node important if it links to many highly nominated nodes (i.e. the person nominates many popular people as their friends). For Authorities, we might consider a node to be of importance if many highly nominated nodes link to it (i.e. nominated by many popular people).\nAuthority Centrality is defined as the sum of the hub centralities which point to the node (i):\n\\[x_i = \\alpha \\sum_{j} A_{ij} y_j,\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is constant. Likewise, Hub Centrality is the sum of the authorities which are pointed by the node \\(i\\):\n\\[y_i = \\beta \\sum_{j} A_{ji} x_j,\\]\nwith constant \\(\\beta\\). Here notice that the element of the adjacency matrix are swapped for Hub Centrality because we are concerned with outgoing edges for hubs. So in matrix notation:\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = \\alpha \\mathbf{Ay}, \\quad\\]\n\\[\\mathbf{y} = \\beta \\mathbf{A^Tx}.\\] As it can be seen from the drawing, HITS Algorithm also tackles the problem with zero in-degree nodes of Eigenvector Centrality. These zero in-degree nodes become central hubs and contribute to other nodes. Yet we can still use a free centrality contribution constant like in Katz Centrality or other variants.\nAlthough these measures are generally used in a citation network or the internet, this can be pretty interesting in the context of our classroom frienship network. Maybe we are interested in knowing who are the non-popular students that nominate many popular students as friends, but receive no reciprocity in terms of nominations."

Call the loaded data college.\nLook at the data using the View() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. Load your data and then try the following commands:\n\n\n#set your working directory ,fill in your code after this line\n\n#read in the file College.csv using read.csv() with option `stringsAsFactors=T`\ncollege <- read.csv('College.csv', stringsAsFactors = T)\n\n#Give data frame college rownames\nrownames(college) <- college[,1] \n\n# Please comment out View function after using it. Otherwise you'll see some error when knit.\n# View(college)\n\n\nYou should see that there is now a row.names column with the name of each university recorded. This means that R has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R will not try to perform calculations on the row names. Next, we will remove the first column in the data where the names are stored. Try\n\n\n#Use a negative number to generate a subset with all but one column\n# college[, -c(1, 2, 3)]  will generate a subset with all but the first three columns\ncollege <- college[,-1]\n# as.factor can turn a character column to a factor column so that we can use it to plot later on\ncollege$Private <- as.factor(college$Private)\n#View(college)\n\nNow you should see that the first data column is Private. Note that another column labeled row.names now appears before the Private column. However, this is not a data column but rather the name that R is giving to each row.\n\nUse the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set. Hint: summary() takes in an object such as data.frame and return the summery results\nUse the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the first five columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first five columns of a data frame dat using dat[,1:5]\nUse the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private.

Recall that you can reference the first five columns of a data frame dat using dat[,1:5]\nUse the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private. Hint: plot() takes two arguments one vector for x axis and one vector for y axis. Try plot(dat$col_name, dat$col_name).\n\n\n# replicate \"No\" for the same times as the number of colleges using rep()\nElite <- rep(\"No\",nrow(college))\n# change the values in Elite for colleges with proportion of students \n# coming from the top 10% of their high school classes \n# exceeds 50 % to \"Yes\"\nElite[college$Top10perc >50] <- \"Yes\"\n# as.factor change ELite, a character vector to a factor vector\n# (we will touch on factors later in class) \nElite <- as.factor(Elite)\n# add the newly created vector to the college data frame\ncollege <- data.frame(college ,Elite)\n\n\nUse the summary() function to see how many elite universities there are. Now use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Elite.\n\nContinue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.\n\n\nISLR Chapter 2 Q9\nThis exercise involves the Auto data set. na.omit() removes the missing values from the data and returns a new data frame.\n\n#load the Auto.csv into a variable called auto using read_csv()\n\n\n# remove all rows with missing values using na.omit()\nauto <- na.omit(auto)\n\nWe can use class() to check which of the columns are quantitative (numeric or integer), and which are qualitative( logical or character). And sapply() function takes in a data frame and a function (in this case class()), apply the class function to each column. Try the following commands:\n\n#apply the class() function to each column of auto data frame\nsapply(auto, class)\n\n\nWhat is the range of each quantitative columns? You can answer this using the range() function. Hint: You can call range() function individually on each column. You can also subset the quantitative columns by creating a variable quant_cols equal to all columns with a numeric mode, then use sapply the function range() with the data frame with only quantitative columns. This is not required.\nUsing the functions mean() and sd(). Find out what is the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative columns?\nNow remove the 10th through 85th observations (rows). What is the range, mean, and standard deviation of each column in the subset of the data that remains? Hint: We’ve seen removing columns in question 8. To remove the rows, we can use the negative sign - again. For example, auto[-c(1,3),] removes the first and third row\nUsing the full data set, investigate the columns graphically, using scatterplots (pairs or plot) or other tools of your choice. Create some plots highlighting the relationships among the columns Comment on your findings.\nSuppose that we wish to predict gas mileage (mpg) on the basis of the other numerical variables. Do your plots suggest that any of the other variables might be useful in predicting mpg? Justify your answer.\n\n\n\nISLR Chapter 2 Q10\nThis exercise involves the Boston housing data set.\nTo begin, load in the Boston data set. The Boston data set is part of the MASS library in R. You may need to install the package using install.packages() function if you haven’t done so.\n\n# install.packages(MASS)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\nNow the data set is contained in the object Boston.\n\nBoston\n\nRead about the data set:\n\n?Boston\n\n\nHow many rows are in this data set? How many columns? What do the rows and columns represent?\nMake some pairwise scatterplots of the columns in this data set. Describe your findings. Hint: Use function pairs()\nHow many of the suburbs in this data set bound the Charles river? Hint: Subset the data using a logical vector to check if variable chas==1, then use nrow() to see the number of suburbs.\nUsing median(), find out what is the median pupil-teacher ratio among the towns in this data set?\n\nWell done!

You can try following steps:\n\nStart by typing ?new_function in your Console to open up the help page\nRead the help page of this new_function. The description might be too technical for now. That’s OK. Pay attention to the Usage and Arguments, especially the argument x or x,y (when two arguments are required)\nAt the bottom of the help page, there are a few examples. Run the first few lines to see how it works\nApply it in your lab questions\n\nIt is highly likely that you will encounter error messages while doing this lab Here are a few steps that might help get you through it.\n\nLocate which line is causing this error first\nCheck if you may have a typo in the code. Sometimes another person can spot a typo faster than you.\nIf you enter the code without any typo, try googling the error message\nScroll through the top few links see if any of them helps\nTry working on the next few questions while waiting for answers by TAs\n\n\n\nWarm-up\n\nIn the lecture, we covered c(), :, rep(), seq() among other ways to create vectors.\n\n\ndolly = c(9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) \nbees = c(\"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\")\n\n\nRecreate dolly using :.\nCreate the same vector using seq().\nRecreate bees using rep().\n\n\nWe are now going to use the functions rnorm() and runif() to initialize vectors.\n\n\nrandom_norm = rnorm(100) \nrandom_unif = runif(1000)\n\n\nHow long are the vectors random_norm and random_unif? Use length() to verify.\nWhat are the largest and smallest values in random_norm and random_unif? Use min() and max().\nUse mean() and sd() to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the two distributions.\nCreate a new vector with 10000 draws from the standard normal distribution.\nrnorm() by default sets mean = 0 (see ?rnorm). Create a vector of 10000 draws from the normal distribution with mean = 1. Use mean() to verify.\n\nNotice the functions min(), max(), mean() and sd() all take a vector with many values and summarize them as one value. These are good to use with summarize() when doing data analysis on simple dataframes.\n\nData Types\n\nUse typeof() to verify the data types of dolly, bees, random_unif\nCoerce dolly to a character vector. Recall we have functions as.<type>() for this kind of coercion.\nTry to coerce bees to type numeric. What does R do when you ask it to turn “b” into a number?\n\n\n\nVectorized Math\n\na and b are vectors of length 10. Look at them in the console.\n\n\na <- 1:10\nb <- rep(c(2, 4), 5)\n\n\nAdd a and b element by element.\nSubtract a and b element by element.\nDivide a by b element by element.\nMultiply a and b element by element.\nRaise the element of a to the power of b element by element.\nMultiply each element of a by 3 then subtract b\nRaise each element of b to the third power.\nTake the square root of each element of a.\n\n\n\nCalculating Mean and Standard Deviation\n\nCalculating the Mean\nIn this exercise, we will calculate the mean of a vector of random numbers. Wewill practice assigning new variables and using functions in R.\nWe can run the following code to create a vector of 1000 random numbers. The function set.seed() ensures that the process used to generate random numbers is the same across computers.\nNote: rf() is a R command we use to generate 1000 random numbers according to the F distribution, and 10 and 100 are parameters that specify how “peaked” the distribution is.\n\nset.seed(1)\nrandom_numbers = rf(1000, 10, 100)\n\nWrite code that gives you the sum of random_numbers and saves it to a new variable called numbers_sum:\nHint: To sum the numbers in a vector, use the sum() function.\nNote: You don’t automatically see the output of numbers_sum when you assign it to a variable. Type numbers_sum into the console and run it to see the value that you assigned it.\nWrite code that gives you the number of items in the random_numbers vector and saves it to a new variable called numbers_count:\nHint: To count the number of items in a vector, use the length() function.\nNow write code that uses the above two variables to calculate the average of random_numbers and assign it to a new variable called this_mean.\nWhat number did you get? It should have been 1.018. If it isn’t, double check your code!\nR actually has a built in function to calculate the mean for you, so you don’t have to remember how to build it from scratch each time! Check your above answer by using the mean() function on the random_numbers vector.\n\n\nCalculating the Standard Deviation\nNow that you’ve got that under your fingers, let’s move on to standard deviation.\nWe will be converting the following formula for calculating the sample standard deviation into code:\n\\(s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2} {n-1}}\\)\nFor this, we’ll review the concept of vectorization. This means that an operation like subtraction will act on all numbers in a vector at the same time.\nSubtract this_mean from the random_numbers vector. Did each number in random_numbers change?\nTry to write the formula for standard deviation in R code using the sqrt(), sum(), and length() functions, along with other operators (^, /, -). Assign it to a new variable called this_sd. Watch out for your parentheses!\nWhat number did you get for this_sd, or the standard deviation of random_numbers? If you didn’t get 0.489704, recheck your code!\nR also has a built in function for standard deviation. Check if you calculated the standard deviation correctly by using the sd() function on the random_numbers vector.\n\n\n\nMaking a Histogram of Our Numbers\nWhat do these random numbers look like, anyway? We can use base plotting in R to visualize the distribution of our random numbers.\nRun the following code to visualize the original distribution of random_numbers as a histogram.\n\nhist(random_numbers)\n\nNotice how most of the values are concentrated on the left-hand side of the graph, while there is a longer “tail” to the right? Counterintuitively, this is known as a right-skewed distribution. When we see a distribution like this, one common thing to do is to normalize it.\nThis is also known as calculating a z-score, which we will cover next.\n\n\nCalculating a Z-Score\nThe formula for calculating a z-score for a single value, or normalizing that value, is as follows:\n\\(z = \\frac{x - \\bar{x}}{s}\\)\nThis can be calculated for each value in random_numbers in context of the larger set of values.\nCan you translate this formula into code?\nUsing random_numbers, this_mean, and this_sd that are already in your environment, write a formula to transform all the values in random_numbers into z-scores, and assign it to the new variable normalized_data.\nHint: R is vectorized, so you can subtract the mean from each random number in random_numbers in a straightforward way.\nTake the mean of normalized_data and assign it to a variable called normalized_mean.\nNote: If you see something that ends in “e-16”, that means that it’s a very small decimal number (16 places to the right of the decimal point), and is essentially 0.\nTake the standard deviation of normalized_data and assign it to a variable called normalized_sd.\nWhat is the value of normalized_mean? What is the value of normalized_sd? You should get a vector that is mean zero and has a standard deviation of one, because the data has been normalized.\n\nMaking a Histogram of Z-scores\nLet’s plot the z-scores and see if our values are still skewed. How does this compare to the histogram of random_numbers? Run the following code:\n\nhist(normalized_data)\n\nIs the resulting data skewed?\n\n\n\n\nCalculating a T-Score\nT-tests are used to determine if two sample means are equal. The formula for calculating a t-score is as follows:\n\\(t = \\frac{\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}\\)\nwhere \\(\\overline{x}_i\\) is the mean of the first or second set of data, \\(s_i\\) is the sample standard deviation of the first or second set of data, and \\(n_i\\) is the sample size of the \\(i\\)th set of data.\nWe’ll first create two data sets of random numbers following a normal distribution:\n\nset.seed(1)\ndata_1 <- rnorm(1000, 3)\ndata_2 <- rnorm(100, 2)\n\nHere’s how we’ll calculate the mean (x_1), standard deviation (s_1), and sample size (n_1) of the first data set:\n\nx_1 <- mean(data_1)\ns_1 <- sd(data_1)\nn_1 <- length(data_1)\n\nWhat numeric types do you get from doing this? Try running the typeof() function on each of x_1, s_1, and n_1. We have you started with x_1.\n\ntypeof(x_1)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nWhat object type is n_1?\nCan you calculate the same values for data_2, assigning mean, standard deviation, and length to the variables of x_2, s_2, and n_2, respectively?\nWhat values do you get for x_2 and s_2?\nNow, you should be able to translate the t-score formula (\\(\\frac{\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}\\)) into code, based on the above calculated values.\nWhat did you get for the t-score? You should have gotten 9.243, if not, double check your code!\nThe t-score’s meaning depends on your sample size, but in general t-scores close to 0 imply that the means are not statistically distinguishable, and large t-scores (e.g. t > 3) imply the data have different means.\n\nPerforming a T-Test\nOnce again, R has a built in function that will perform a T-test for us, aptly named t.test(). Look up the arguments the function t.test() takes, and perform a T-test on data_1 and data_2.\nWhat are the sample means, and are they distinguishable from each other?\nWell done! You’ve learned how to work with R to calculate basic statistics. We’ve had you generate a few by hand, but be sure to use the built-in functions in R in the future.\nWant to improve this tutorial?

That’s because we have a bunch of NAs. Let’s filter out the NAs and remake the plot. You cannot test for NA using == (Try: NA == NA). Instead we have a function called is.na(). (Try: is.na(NA) and !is.na(NA)).\nUse two dplyr verbs to figure out what year the bottom 50 percent held the least wealth. First, choose the rows that cover the bottom 50 percent and then sort the data in descending order using arrange()2.\n\n2 Hint: Look at the examples in ?arrange\n# replace ... with relevant code\nrussian_data %>% \n  filter(...) %>% \n  arrange(...)\n\n\nFor both the Russian Federation and French data, calculate the average proportion of wealth owned by the top 10 percent over the period from 1995 to 2010. You’ll have to filter and then summarize with summarize().\n\n\n# replace ... with relevant code\nrussian_data %>% \n  filter(...) %>% \n  summarize(top10 = mean(...))\n\n\n\nManipulating Midwest Demographic Data with dplyr\n\nNow we’ll use midwestern demographic data which is at this link. The dataset includes county level data for a single year. We call data this type of data “cross-sectional” since it gives a point-in-time cross-section of the counties of the midwest. (The world inequality data is “timeseries” data).\nSave midwest.dta in your data folder and load it into R.\n\n\nmidwest <- read_dta('midwest.dta')\n\n\nRun the following code to get a sense of what the data looks like:\n\n\nglimpse(midwest)\n\n\nI wanted a tibble called midwest_pop that only had county identifiers and the 9 columns from midwest concerned with population counts. Replicate my work to create midwest_pop on your own3.\n\n3 Hint: notice that all the columns start with the same few letters.\nnames(midwest_pop)\n\n [1] \"county\"          \"state\"           \"poptotal\"        \"popdensity\"     \n [5] \"popwhite\"        \"popblack\"        \"popamerindian\"   \"popasian\"       \n [9] \"popother\"        \"popadults\"       \"poppovertyknown\"\n\n\nHint: I went to ?select and found a selection helper that allowed me to select those 9 columns without typing all their names\n\n# replace ... with relevant code\nmidwest_pop <- midwest %>% select(county, state, ...)\n\n\nFrom midwest_pop calculate the area of each county4. What’s the largest county in the midwest? How about in Illinois?\nFrom midwest_pop calculate percentage adults for each county. What county in the midwest has the highest proportion of adults? What’s county in the midwest has the lowest proportion of adults?\nHow many people live in Michigan?\nNote that together population density and population can give you information about the area (geographic size) of a location. What’s the total area of Illinois? You probably have no idea what the units are though. If you google, you’ll find that it doesn’t align perfectly with online sources. Given the units don’t align with other sources, can this data still be useful?\n\n4 Notice that \\(popdensity = \\frac{poptotal}{area}\\)Well done!

By default arrange sorts in ascending order, which is what we want here – we’re interested in the major with the lowest unemployment rate.\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  arrange(unemployment_rate)\n\n# A tibble: 173 × 21\n    rank major…¹ major major…² total sampl…³ men   women share…⁴ emplo…⁵ emplo…⁶\n   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <dbl> <chr> <chr> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1    53    4005 Math… Comput… 609         7 500   109   0.1789…     559     584\n 2    74    3801 Mili… Indust… 124         4 124   0     0             0     111\n 3    84    3602 Bota… Biolog… 1329        9 626   703   0.5289…    1010     946\n 4   113    1106 Soil… Agricu… 685         4 476   209   0.3051…     613     488\n 5   121    2301 Educ… Educat… 804         5 280   524   0.6517…     703     733\n 6    15    2409 Engi… Engine… 4321       30 3526  795   0.1839…    3608    2999\n 7    20    3201 Cour… Law & … 1148       14 877   271   0.2360…     930     808\n 8   120    2305 Math… Educat… 14237     123 3872  10365 0.7280…   13115   11259\n 9     1    2419 Petr… Engine… 2339       36 2057  282   0.1205…    1976    1849\n10    65    1100 Gene… Agricu… 10399     158 6053  4346  0.4179…    8884    7589\n# … with 163 more rows, 10 more variables: employed_parttime <dbl>,\n#   employed_fulltime_yearround <dbl>, unemployed <dbl>,\n#   unemployment_rate <dbl>, p25th <dbl>, median <dbl>, p75th <dbl>,\n#   college_jobs <dbl>, non_college_jobs <dbl>, low_wage_jobs <dbl>, and\n#   abbreviated variable names ¹​major_code, ²​major_category, ³​sample_size,\n#   ⁴​sharewomen, ⁵​employed, ⁶​employed_fulltime\n\n\nThis gives us what we wanted, but not in an ideal form. First, the name of the major barely fits on the page.

Not really!\n\n1a. Round unemployment_rate: We create a new variable with the mutate function. In this case, we’re overwriting the existing unemployment_rate variable, by rounding it to 1 decimal places. Incomplete code is given below to guide you in the right direction, however you will need to fill in the blanks.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads<- college_recent_grads %>%\n  arrange(unemployment_rate) %>%\n  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate) %>%\n  mutate(unemployment_rate = ___(___, 1))\n\nWhile were making some changes, let’s change sharewomen to numeric (it appears to be a string). Make sure to save your changes by overwriting the existing data frame!\n\ncollege_recent_grads <- college_recent_grads %>%\n  mutate(sharewomen = as.numeric(___))\n\n\n\nWhich major has the highest percentage of women?\nTo answer such a question we need to arrange the data in descending order. For example, if earlier we were interested in the major with the highest unemployment rate, we would use the following:\nThe desc function specifies that we want unemployment_rate in descending order.\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  arrange(desc(unemployment_rate)) %>%\n  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate)\n\n# A tibble: 173 × 3\n    rank major                                      unemployment_rate\n   <dbl> <chr>                                                  <dbl>\n 1     6 Nuclear Engineering                                    0.177\n 2    90 Public Administration                                  0.159\n 3    85 Computer Networking And Telecommunications             0.152\n 4   171 Clinical Psychology                                    0.149\n 5    30 Public Policy                                          0.128\n 6   106 Communication Technologies                             0.120\n 7     2 Mining And Mineral Engineering                         0.117\n 8    54 Computer Programming And Data Processing               0.114\n 9    80 Geography                                              0.113\n10    59 Architecture                                           0.113\n# … with 163 more rows\n\n\n\n1b. Using what you’ve learned so far, arrange the data in descending order with respect to proportion of women in a major, and display only the major, the total number of people with major, and proportion of women. Show only the top 3 majors by adding head(3) at the end of the pipeline.\n\n\n#code here\n\n\n\nHow do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\nA percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: Wikipedia\nThere are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: p25th, median, and p75th. These correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.\nThe question we want to answer “How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?”. We need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by major_category. Then, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups. This decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions. So first, we need to visualize the data.\n\n1c.Let’s start simple and take a look at the distribution of all median incomes using geom_histogram, without considering the major categories.\n\n\nggplot(data = ____,\n       mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n1d. Try binwidths of \\(1000\\) and \\(5000\\) and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice.\n\n\nggplot(data = ___,\n       mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = ___)\n\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function:\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n    min    max   mean   med     sd    q1    q3\n  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 22000 110000 40151. 36000 11470. 33000 45000\n\n\n\n1e. Based on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous 1e, determine which of these summary statistics above (min, max, mean, med, sd, q1, q3) is/are useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description and include the summary statistic output as well.You can pick single/multiple statistics and briefly explain why you pick it/them.\n1f. Next, we facet the plot by major category. Plot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in 1e.\n\n\nggplot(data = ___,\n       mapping = aes (x=median)) +\n  geom_histogram(bindwidth = 5000) +\n  facet_wrap(.~major_category)\n\n\n1g. Use filter to find out which major has the highest median income? lowest? Which major has the median() median income? Hint: refer to the statistics in 1d.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  ____(median == ____) \n\n\n1h. Which major category is the most popular in this sample? To answer this question we use a new function called count, which first groups the data , then counts the number of observations in each category and store the counts into a column named n. Add to the pipeline appropriately to arrange the results so that the major with the highest observations is on top.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  count(major_category) %>% \n  ___(___(n))\n\n\n\nWhat types of majors do women tend to major in?\nFirst, let’s create a new vector called stem_categories that lists the major categories that are considered STEM fields.\n\nstem_categories <- c(\"Biology & Life Science\",\n                     \"Computers & Mathematics\",\n                     \"Engineering\",\n                     \"Physical Sciences\")\n\nThen, we can use this to create a new variable in our data frame indicating whether a major is STEM or not.\n\ncollege_recent_grads <- college_recent_grads %>%\n  mutate(major_type = ifelse(major_category %in% \n                               stem_categories, \"stem\", \"not stem\"))\n\nLet’s unpack this: with mutate we create a new variable called major_type, which is defined as \"stem\" if the major_category is in the nector called stem_categories we created earlier, and as \"not stem\" otherwise.\n\n1i. Create a scatterplot of median income vs. proportion of women in that major, colored by whether the major is in a STEM field or not. Describe the association between these three variables.\n\n\nggplot(data = ___, \n       mapping = aes(x=median, \n           y= sharewomen, \n           color=major_type)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n1j.. We can use the logical operators to also filter our data for STEM majors whose median earnings is less than median for all majors’s median earnings, which we found to be $36,000 earlier. Your output should only show the major name and median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile earning for that major and should be sorted such that the major with the lowest median earning is on top.\n\n\n#code here\n\nWell done!

Sometimes another person can spot a typo faster than you.\nIf you enter the code without any typo, try googling the error message\nScroll through the top few links see if any of them helps\nTry working on the next few questions while waiting for answers by TAs\n\n\n\nBackground and Data\nRead the background and data section before lab.\n\nFollow the tweet thread and you’ll see how Professor Damon Jones, of Harris, prepares and analyzes his data. In this lab, you’re going to follow his lead and dig into traffic stop data from the University of Chicago Police Department, one of the largest private police forces in the world.\n\n\nWarm-up\n\nOpen a new Rmd and save it in your coding lab folder; if you downloaded the data, move your data file to your preferred data location.\nIn your Rmd, write code to load your packages. If you load packages in the console, you will get an error when you knit because knitting starts a fresh R session.\nLoad data_traffic.csv and assign it to the name traffic_data. This data was scrapped from the UCPD website and partially cleaned by Prof. Jones.\nRecall that group_by() operates silently. Below I create a new data frame called grouped_data.\n\n\ngrouped_data <- traffic_data %>%\n  group_by(Race, Gender)\n\n\n\nHow can you tell grouped_data is different from traffic_data?\n\n\nHow many groups (Race-Gender pairs) are in the data? (This information should be available without writing additional code!)\n\n\nWithout running the code, predict the dimensions (number of rows by number of columns) of the tibbles created by traffic_data %>% summarize(n = n()) and grouped_data %>% summarize(n = n()).\n\n\nNow check you intuition by running the code.\n\n\n\nUse group_by() and summarize() to recreate the following table.\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  Race                                       n\n  <chr>                                  <int>\n1 African American                        3278\n2 American Indian/Alaskan Native            12\n3 Asian                                    226\n4 Caucasian                                741\n5 Hispanic                                 217\n6 Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander     4\n\n\n\nUse count() to produce the same table.\n\n\n\nMoving beyond counts\n\nRaw counts are okay, but frequencies (or proportions) are easier to compare across data sets. Add a column with frequencies and assign the new tibble to the name traffic_stop_freq. The result should be identical to Prof. Jones’s analysis on twitter.\n\nTry on your own first. If you’re not sure how to add a frequency though, you could google “add a proportion to count with tidyverse” and find this stackoverflow post. Follow the advice of the number one answer. The green checkmark and large number of upvotes indicate the answer is likely reliable.\n\nThe frequencies out of context are not super insightful. What additional information do we need to argue the police are disproportionately stopping members of a certain group? (Hint: Prof. Jones shares the information in his tweets.)\nFor the problem above, your groupmate tried the following code. Explain why the frequencies are all 1.\n\n\ntraffic_stop_freq_bad <- traffic_data %>%\n  group_by(Race) %>% \n  summarize(n = n(),\n            freq = n / sum(n)) \n\ntraffic_stop_freq_bad\n\nNow we want to go a step further. Do outcomes differ by race? In the first code block below, I provide code so you can visualize disposition by race. “Disposition” is police jargon that means the current status or final outcome of a police interaction.\n\ncitation_strings <- c(\"citation issued\", \"citations issued\",\n                      \"citation issued\" )\n\narrest_strings <- c(\"citation issued, arrested on active warrant\",\n                    \"citation issued; arrested on warrant\",\n                    \"arrested by cpd\", \"arrested on warrant\",\n                    \"arrested\",\"arrest\")\n\ndisposition_by_race <- traffic_data %>%\n  mutate(Disposition = str_to_lower(Disposition),\n         Disposition = case_when(Disposition %in% citation_strings ~ \"citation\",\n                                 Disposition %in% arrest_strings ~ \"arrest\",\n                                 TRUE ~ Disposition)) %>%\n  count(Race, Disposition) %>% group_by(Race) %>%\n  mutate(freq = round(n / sum(n), 3))\n\ndisposition_by_race %>%\n  filter(n > 5, Disposition == \"citation\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = freq, x = Race)) + geom_col() +\n  labs(y = \"Citation Rate Once Stopped\", x = \"\", title = \"Traffic Citation Rate\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down how we got to this code. First, I ran traffic_data %>% count(Race, Disposition) and noticed that we have a lot of variety in how officers enter information into the system. I knew I could deal with some of the issue by standardizing capitalization.\n\n\nIn the console, try out str_to_lower(...) by replacing the … with different strings. The name may be clear enough, but what does str_to_lower() do?\n\n\nAfter using mutate with str_to_lower(), I piped into count() again and looked for strings that represent the same Disposition. I stored terms in character vectors (e.g. citation_strings). The purpose is to make the case_when() easier to code and read. Once I got that right, I added frequencies to finalize disposition_by_race.\n\nTo make the graph, I first tried to get all the disposition data on the same plot.\n\n\n disposition_by_race %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = freq, x = Race, fill = Disposition)) + \n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the bar graph is stacked. Look at the resulting graph and discuss the pros and cons of this plot.\n\nI decided I would focus on citations only and added the filter(n > 5, Disposition == \"citation\") to the code. What is the impact of filtering based on n > 5? Would you make the same choice? This question doesn’t have a “right” answer. You should try different options and reflect.\nNow, you can create a similar plot based called “Search Rate” using the Search variable. Write code to re-produce this plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell done! You’ve learned how to conduct grouped analysis using real-world data!\nWant to improve this tutorial? Report any suggestions/bugs/improvements on here! We’re interested in learning from you how we can make this tutorial better."

The most common structure for your code will look like the following code. This can be simplified if you are not storing results.\n\n# what are you iterating over? The vector from -10:10\nitems_to_iterate_over <- c(-10:10) \n\n# pre-allocate the results\nout <- rep(0, length(items_to_iterate_over))\n# write the iteration statement --\n# we'll use indices so we can store the output easily \nfor (i in seq_along(items_to_iterate_over)) {\n# do something\n# we capture the median of three random numbers\n# from normal distributions various means\n    out[[i]] <- median(rnorm(n = 3,mean = items_to_iterate_over[[i]]))\n    }\n\n\nWriting for-loops\n\nWrite a for-loop that prints the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, 250000.\nWrite a for-loop that iterates over the indices of x and prints the ith value of x.\n\n\nx <- c(5, 10, 15, 20, 250000)\n# replace the ... with the relevant code\n\nfor (i in ... ){ \n  print(x[[...]])\n  }\n\n\nWrite a for-loop that simplifies the following code so that you don’t repeat yourself! Don’t worry about storing the output yet. Use print() so that you can see the output. What happens if you don’t use print()?\n\n\nsd(rnorm(5))\nsd(rnorm(10))\nsd(rnorm(15))\nsd(rnorm(20)) \nsd(rnorm(25000))\n\n\nadjust your for-loop to see how the sd changes when you use rnorm(n, mean = 4)\nadjust your for-loop to see how the sd changes when you use rnorm(n, sd = 4)\n\n\nNow store the results of your for-loop above in a vector. Pre-allocate a vector of length 5 to capture the standard deviations.\n\n\n\nvectorization vs for loops\nRecall, vectorized functions operate on a vector item by item. It’s like looping over the vector! The following for-loop is better written vectorized.\nCompare the loop version\n\nnames <- c(\"Marlene\", \"Jacob\", \"Buddy\")\nout <- character(length(names))\n\nfor (i in seq_along(names)) {\n  out[[i]] <- paste0(\"Welcome \", names[[i]])\n  }\n\nto the vectorized version\n\nnames <- c(\"Marlene\", \"Jacob\", \"Buddy\") \nout <- paste0(\"Welcome \", names)\n\nThe vectorized code is preferred because it is easier to write and read, and is possibly more efficient.\n\nRewrite your first for-loop, where you printed 5, 10, 15, 20, 250000 as vectorised code\nRewrite this for-loop as vectorized code:\n\n\nradii <- c(0:10)\n\narea <- double(length(radii)) \n\nfor (i in seq_along(radii)) { \n  area[[i]] <- pi * radii[[i]] ^ 2 \n  }\n\n\nRewrite this for-loop as vectorized code:\n\n\nradii <- c(-1:10)\n\narea <- double(length(radii))\n\nfor (i in seq_along(radii)) { \n  if (radii[[i]] < 0) { \n    area[[i]] <- NaN \n  } else {\n      area[[i]] <- pi * radii[[i]] ^ 2 }\n  }\n\n\n\n\nExtension\n\nSimulating the Law of Large Numbers\nThe Law of Large Numbers says that as sample sizes increase, the mean of the sample will approach the true mean of the distribution. We are going to simulate this phenomenon!\nWe’ll start by making a vector of sample sizes from 1 to 50, to represent increasing sample sizes.\nCreate a vector called sample_sizes that is made up of the numbers 1 through 50. (Hint: You can use seq() or : notation).\nWe’ll make an empty tibble to store the results of the for loop:\n\nestimates <- tibble(n = integer(), sample_mean = double())\n\nWrite a loop over the sample_sizes you specified above. In the loop, for each sample size you will:\n\nCalculate the mean of a sample from the random normal distribution with mean = 0 and sd = 5.\nMake an intermediate tibble to store the results\nAppend the intermediate tibble to your tibble using bind_rows().\n\n\nset.seed(60637) \nfor (___ in ___) {\n  # Calculate the mean of a sample from the random normal distribution with mean = 0 and s\n  ___ <- ___\n  # Make a tibble with your estimates\n  this_estimate <- tibble(n = ___, sample_mean = ___) \n  # Append the new rows to your tibble\n  ___ <- bind_rows(estimates, ___)\n  }\n\nWe can use ggplot2 to view the results. Fill in the correct information for the data and x and y variables, so that the n column of the estimates tibble is plotted on the x-axis, while the sample_mean column of the estimates tibble is plotted on the y-axis.\n\n# your data goes in the first position\n___ %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = ___, y = ___)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\nAs the sample size (n) increases, does the sample mean becomes closer to 0, or farther away from 0?\n\nRewrite the loop code without looking at your previous code and use a wider range of sample sizes. Try several different sample size combinations. What happens when you increase the sample size to 100? 500? 1000? Use the seq() function to generate a sensibly spaced sequence.\n\nset.seed(60637) \nsample_sizes <- ___ \nestimates_larger_n <- ___\n\nfor (___ in ___) {\n  ___ <- ___\n  ___ <- ___\n  ___ <- ___\n}\n\n___ %>%\n  ggplot(___(___ = ___, ___ = ___)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\nHow does this compare to before?\n\n\n\nExtending Our Simulation\nLooking at your results, you might think a small sample size is sufficient for estimating a mean, but your data had a relatively small standard deviation compared to the mean. Let’s run the same simulation as before with different standard deviations.\nDo the following:\n\nCreate a vector called population_sd of length 4 with values 1, 5, 10, and 20 (you’re welcome to add larger numbers if you wish).\nMake an empty tibble to store the output. Compared to before, this has an extra column for the changing population standard deviations.\nWrite a loop inside a loop over population_sd and then sample_sizes.\nThen, make a ggplot graph where the x and y axes are the same, but we facet (aka we create small multiples of individual graphs) on population_sd.\n\n\nset.seed(60637)\npopulation_sd <- ___\n# use what every you came up with in the previous part \nsample_sizes <- ___\nestimates_adjust_sd <- ___\nfor (___ in ___){ \n  for (___ in ___) {\n    ___ <- ___\n    ___ <- ___\n    ___ <- ___\n  } \n}\n\n___ %>%\n  ggplot(___) +\n  geom_line() + \n  facet_wrap(~population_sd) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nHow do these estimates differ as you increase the standard deviation?\nWant to improve this tutorial?

For example:\n\n\ncalc_quadratic(5)\n\n[1] 36\n\n\n\nWhat are the arguments to your function? What is the body of the function?\nThis function is vectorized! (Since binary operators are vectorized). Show this is true by running calc_quadratic with an input vector that is -10 to 10.\n\n\nYou realize you want to be able to work with any quadratic. Update your functions so that it can work with any quadratic in standard form \\(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\n\nYour new function will take arguments x, a, b and c.\nSet the default arguments to a=1, b=2 and c=1.\n\n\nWrite a function called solve_quadratic that takes arguments a, b and c and provides the two roots using the quadratic formula.\n\nIn our outline, we suggest you:\n\nCalculate the determinant \\(\\sqrt{b^2 − 4ac}\\) and store as an intermediate value.\nReturn two values by putting them in a vector. If you stored the roots as root_1 and root_2, then the final line of code in the function should be c(root_1, root_2) or, if you prefer, return(c(root_1, root_2)).\n\n\n# fill in the ... with appropriate code\nsolve_quadratic <- function(...){\n  determinant <- ...\n  root_1 <- ...\n  root_2 <- ...\n  c(root_1, root_2)\n}\n\nThe code should work as follows:\n\nsolve_quadratic(a = -4, b = 0, c = 1)\n\n[1] -0.5  0.5\n\n\n\nWe “normalize” a variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation \\(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\) .\n\nWrite a function called normalize that takes a vector as input and normalizes it. You should get the following output.\n\nnormalize(1:5)\n\n[1] -1.2649111 -0.6324555  0.0000000  0.6324555  1.2649111\n\n\n\nWhat output do you get when the input vector is 0:4? How about -100:-96? Why?\nWhat happens when your input vector is c(1,2,3,4,5, NA)? Rewrite the function so the result is:\nThe txhousing data set comes with ggplot. Use your normalize function in mutate to create normalized_annual_volume to make the following graph.\n\n\n# replace the ... with the appropriate code.\ntxhousing %>%\n  group_by(year, city) %>%\n  summarize(annual_volume = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n  group_by(year) %>%\n  mutate(...) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = normalized_annual_volume)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(aes(color = city))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulating Data with Monte Carlo Simulations (Extension)\nYou will be asked to investigate statistical concepts using Monte Carlo simulations. We’ll try not to get too technical in the main body of the lab. There are some “technical notes” which you can ignore!\nIn a monte carlo simulation, you repeatedly:\n\nGenerate random samples of data using a known process.\nMake calculations based on the random sample.\nAggregate the results.\n\nFunctions and loops help us do these repetitious acts efficiently, without repeatedly writing similar code or copying and pasting.\nToday’s problem: Let us investigate how good the random number generator in R is.1 We hypothesize that rnorm(n, mean = true_mean) provides random sample of size n from the normal distribution with mean = true_mean and standard deviation = 1.\nThe lesson is organized as follows.\n\nWe do a single simulation.\nWe take the logic of the simulation, encapsulate it in functions and then run 1000s of simulations!\n\n\nA single simulation\nRecall our hypothesis is that rnorm() faithfully gives us random numbers from the normal distribution. If we test this with a single random draw, we might be misled. For example, let’s draw 30 numbers from a normal distribution with true mean of 0.5 and see if the observed mean appears statistically different from the true mean.\n\n# Setting a seed ensures replicability\nset.seed(4)\n# we set our parameters\ntrue_mean <- .5\nN <- 30\n# We simulate and observe outcomes\nsimulated_data <- rnorm(N, mean = true_mean) # the standard deviation is 1 by default!\nobs_mean <- mean(simulated_data)\nobs_mean\n\n[1] 0.9871873\n\n\nWow! The observed mean is twice what we expected given true_mean! Let’s calculate a z-score to put that in perspective. (Focus on the formulas, you’ll learn the intuition in stats class)\nA z-score is calculated \\(\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{\\frac{s_n}{\\sqrt{N}}}\\) where \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean, \\(\\mu\\) is the true mean, \\(s_n\\) is the sample standard deviation and \\(N\\) is the number of observations.\n\nobs_sd <- sd(simulated_data)\nzscore <- (obs_mean - true_mean) / (obs_sd / sqrt(N)) \nzscore\n\n[1] 3.303849\n\n\nWe expect the observed mean of this simulated data will be within 1.96 standard deviations of \\(\\mu\\) 95 out of 100 times.This observation is 3.3 standard deviations from Mu. The probability of that happening by chance is very small. To be more formal about this probability, we can calculate a p-value. Plug in the z-score below:\n\n(1 - pnorm(abs(zscore)))*2\n\n[1] 0.000953672\n\n\nThis says that the probability of getting this draw by chance is less than 0.1 percent or 1 in 1000.\nThat outcome seems surprising, but we could also just have made an unusual draw. In this workshop, we want to see how often we get such extreme results. We will repeat the steps above 1000 times each, but first we’ll write functions that will make this process smooth!\n\n\nWriting Helper Functions to Make Our Monte Carlo Simulation\nWe want to develop functions that automate repeated steps in our Monte Carlo. In that way, we can define a few important parameters and run the entire process without rewriting or copying and pasting code over and over again.\nAs you saw in the motivating example, we must do the following a 1000 times or B times if parameterize the number of iterations with B:\n\nSimulate data and calculate sample statistics.\nDetermine z-scores.\nTest whether the z-score is outside the threshold. Finally, we:\nMeasure to what extent our simulations match the theory.\n\nTo proceed, we’ll write the steps into their own functions, then call them in the right order in the function do_monte_carlo(). We are breaking a complicated process into smaller chunks and tackling them one by one!\nLet’s look at do_monte_carlo(). It takes a sample-size N, a true_mean, number of iterations B (1000 by default) and a significance level alpha (.05 by default). It returns the proportion of observed means that are significantly different from the true_mean with 95 percent confidence level\n\nBefore following our road map, think about how you would set up functions to automate this process. What would the inputs and outputs be of each step/function? Your processes will be different from ours, but that doesn’t mean ours is better.\n\nNow check out do_monte_carlo() below. It’s our road map.\n\ndo_monte_carlo <- function(N, true_mean, B= 1000, alpha = .05){\n# step 1: Simulate B random samples and calculate sample statistics\n  sample_statistics <- make_mc_sample(N, true_mean, B)\n# step 2: Determine z-scores\n  z_scores <- get_zscores(sample_statistics$mean, true_mean, sample_statistics$sd, N)\n# step 3: Test whether the z-scores are outside the threshold.\n  significance <- test_significance(z_scores, alpha)\n# step 4: Measure to what extent our simulations match the theory. (We expect a number close to alpha)\n  mean(significance)\n}\n\n\n\nDetermine z-scores\nWe’ll start with step 2 determine z-scores. Recall the formula for a zscore is\\(\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{\\frac{s_n}{\\sqrt{N}}}\\).\nWrite a function called get_zscores that takes the observed means and sds, the true mean and N as inputs and returns a z-score as an output. Name the arguments obs_mean, true_mean, obs_sd, and N.\n\n\n\nIf your functions works, it should return 4 for test.\n\ntest <- get_zscores(obs_mean = 4.4, true_mean = 4.3, obs_sd = 0.25, N = 100)\ntest\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThe function you wrote should also work on vectorized functions. Run the following code which takes estimates of the mean and standard deviation from 5 random draws and returns their associated z-scores:\n\n# before running set eval = TRUE (and delete this comment)\nmade_up_means <- c(4.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.2)\nmade_up_sd <- c(.25, .5, .4, 1, .4)\nmade_up_zscores <- get_zscores(obs_mean = made_up_means,\n                               true_mean = 4.3,\n                               obs_sd = made_up_sd,\n                               N = 100)\nmade_up_zscores\n\n\nWhich observation from made_up_zscores is not statistically different from 4.3 with 95 percent confidence? In other words, which observed mean and standard deviation return \\(|z-score| < 1.96\\)?\n\n\n\n\nCheck for Significance\nNow we write code for step 3. Test whether the z-scores are outside the threshold.\nThe threshold depends on alpha and the formula is abs(qnorm(alpha/2)).\n\nFor example, for a two-tailed z-test at the 95% confidence level, the cutoff is set at 1.96. Verify this using the formula above.\nWrite a function test_significance() that takes zscores and a given alpha and determines if there is a significant difference at the given level.\n\nRun the following code, and check that your code matches the expected output:\n\n# before knitting set eval = TRUE (and delete this comment)\ntest_significance(zscores = 2, alpha = 0.05)\n\nShould return TRUE. And:\n\n# before knitting set eval = TRUE (and delete this comment)\ntest_significance(zscores = c(1.9, -0.3, -3), alpha = 0.05)\n\nShould return FALSE, FALSE, and TRUE.\n\nBuilding make_mc_sample()\nNow we do step 1: simulate B random samples and calculate sample statistics.\nOur goal is make_mc_sample(N, true_mean, B) a function that produces sample statistics from B random samples from the normal distribution with mean true_mean of size N. When you think of doing something B times it suggest we need a loop. Let’s start with the body of the loop. And because we’re in a lesson about functions, let’s write a function.\n\nWrite a function called calc_mean_and_sd_from_sample() that\n\n\nGenerates a random sample with rnorm() of size N centered around true_mean\nCalculate the mean() and sd() of the random sample.\nReturn the mean and sd in a tibble with column names mean and sd.\n\nIdea: To return two values from a function, we need to put those values into a data structure like a vector or tibble.\nHere’s a test! Verify your function works. Remember, what guarantees that you get the same numbers from a random number generator as we did is that we’re setting a seed to 5\n\n# before knitting set eval = TRUE (and delete this comment)\nset.seed(5)\ncalc_mean_and_sd_from_sample(N = 30, true_mean = 0.5)\n\nNow, this function only does what we need once, while we’ll need it to do it B times. This is an appropriate time for a loop!\n\nWrite the function make_mc_sample. The inputs are described above. The output is a tibble with B rows of means and standard deviations.\n\nHere’s a test.\n\nset.seed(24601)\nmake_mc_sample(N = 30, true_mean = 100, B = 3 )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n   mean    sd\n  <dbl> <dbl>\n1  99.8 0.920\n2  99.8 0.952\n3 100.  1.04 \n\n\n\n\nFunctions, Assemble\nNow you have all the helper functions that are critical for our simulation. We want to simulate 1000 sets of 30 data points drawn from a normal distribution with true mean 0.5 and then see how often our random sample mean is significantly different from the true mean at a significance level of 0.05. If everything is working as expected, we should see about 5% of the random means to be statistically different.\n\ndo_monte_carlo <- function(N, true_mean, B = 1000, alpha = .05){\n# step 1: Simulate B random samples and calculate sample statistics\nsample_statistics <- make_mc_sample(N, true_mean, B)\n# step 2: Determine z-scores\nz_scores <- get_zscores(sample_statistics$mean, true_mean, sample_statistics$sd, N)\n# step 3: Test whether the z-scores are outside the threshold.\nsignificance <- test_significance(z_scores, alpha)\n# step 5: Measure to what extent our simulations match the theory. (We expect a number close to alpha)\nmean(significance)\n}\n\n\nTest out your function with N equals 30 and true_mean equals 0.5. The resulting number should be close to .05 (alpha).\nTry again with a different alpha and verify that do_monte_carlo returns a number in the ball park of alpha.\n\nWant to improve this tutorial?
