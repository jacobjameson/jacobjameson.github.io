What if you wanted to get the tail end of your data instead?\nImagine you have a data set, df with 4 variables, county, year, income, and employment. You only need the year and employment status of people whose income is below $5000. Which two dplyr commands do you need to do this? Can you write the code for this?\nRemember the mean() function? What dplyr commands would we need if we want the average income in counties for the year 2003? Can you write the code for this?\nLoad tidyverse, haven, and readxl in your Rmd. If you haven’t yet, download the data from this page and put the data in your data folder and set your working directory. The data source is the World Inequality Database where you can find data about the distribution of income and wealth in several contries over time. Outside of lab time, check out wid.world for more information.\nIf you followed the set-up from above, you should be able to run the following code with no error.\n\n\nwid_data &lt;- read_xlsx(\"world_wealth_inequality.xlsx\")\n\n\n\nExamining ’wid_data\n\nLook at the data. What is the main problem here?\nWe don’t have columns headers. The World Inequality Database says the “structure” of the download is as shown in the image below.\n\n\nSo we can create our own header in read_xlsx. Calling the read_xlsx function using readxl::read_xlsx() ensures that we use the read_xlsx() function from the readxl package.\n\nwid_data_raw &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(\"world_wealth_inequality.xlsx\",\n                                   col_names = c(\"country\", \"indicator\",\n                                                 \"percentile\", \"year\", \"value\"))\n\nNow when we look at the second column. It’s a mess. We can separate it based on where the \\n are and then deal with the data later. Don’t worry about this code right now.\n\nwid_data_raw &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(\"world_wealth_inequality.xlsx\",\n                                  col_names = c(\"country\", \"indicator\",\n                                                \"percentile\", \"year\", \n                                                \"value\")) %&gt;%\n  separate(indicator, sep = \"\\\\n\", into = c(\"row_tag\", \"type\", \"notes\"))\n\nNote: We want a clean reproducible script so you should just have one block of code reading the data: that last one. The other code were building blocks. If you want to keep “extra” code temporarily in your script you can use # to comment out the code.\n\n\nManipulating World Inequality Data with dplyr\nNow we have some data and are ready to use select(), filter(), mutate(), summarize() and arrange() to explore it.\n\nThe data comes with some redundant columns that add clutter when we examine the data. What dplyr verb let’s you choose what columns to see? Remove the unwanted column row_tag and move notes to the last column position and assign the output to the name wid_data1\nLet’s start to dig into the data. We have two types of data: “Net personal wealth” and “National income”. Start by filter()ing the data so we only have “Net personal wealth” for France, name the resulting data french_data and then run the code below to visualize the data.\n\n\n# replace each ... with relevant code\nfrench_data &lt;- wid_data %&gt;% filter( ... , ...)\n\nNote: When refering to words in the data, make sure they are in quotes “France”, “Net personal wealth”. When referring to columns, do not use quotes.\n\nfrench_data %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(y = value, x = year, color = percentile)) + \n  geom_line()\n\nNow we’re getting somewhere! The plot shows the proportion of national wealth owned by different segements of French society overtime. For example in 2000, the top 1 percent owned roughly 28 percent of the wealth, while the bottom 50 percent owned abouy 7 percent.\n\nExplain the gaps in the plot. Using filter(), look at french_data in the years between 1960 and 1970. Does what you see line up with what you guessed by looking at the graph?\nUsing mutate(), create a new column called perc_national_wealth that equals value multiplied by 100. Adjust the graph code so that the y axis shows perc_national_wealth instead of value.\nNow following the same steps, explore data from the “Russian Federation”.\nThe data for “Russian Federation” does not start in 1900, but our y-axis does. That’s because we have a bunch of NAs. Let’s filter out the NAs and remake the plot. You cannot test for NA using == (Try: NA == NA). Instead we have a function called is.na(). (Try: is.na(NA) and !is.na(NA)).\nUse two dplyr verbs to figure out what year the bottom 50 percent held the least wealth. First, choose the rows that cover the bottom 50 percent and then sort the data in descending order using arrange()2.\n\n\n# replace ... with relevant code\nrussian_data %&gt;% \n  filter(...) %&gt;% \n  arrange(...)\n\n\nFor both the Russian Federation and French data, calculate the average proportion of wealth owned by the top 10 percent over the period from 1995 to 2010. You’ll have to filter and then summarize with summarize().\n\n\n# replace ... with relevant code\nrussian_data %&gt;% \n  filter(...) %&gt;% \n  summarize(top10 = mean(...))\n\n\n\nManipulating Midwest Demographic Data with dplyr\n\nNow we’ll use midwestern demographic data which is at this link. The dataset includes county level data for a single year. We call data this type of data “cross-sectional” since it gives a point-in-time cross-section of the counties of the midwest. (The world inequality data is “timeseries” data).\nSave midwest.dta in your data folder and load it into R.\n\n\nmidwest &lt;- read_dta('midwest.dta')\n\n\nRun the following code to get a sense of what the data looks like:\n\n\nglimpse(midwest)\n\n\nI wanted a tibble called midwest_pop that only had county identifiers and the 9 columns from midwest concerned with population counts. Replicate my work to create midwest_pop on your own3.\n\n\nnames(midwest_pop)\n\n [1] \"county\"          \"state\"           \"poptotal\"        \"popdensity\"     \n [5] \"popwhite\"        \"popblack\"        \"popamerindian\"   \"popasian\"       \n [9] \"popother\"        \"popadults\"       \"poppovertyknown\"\n\n\nHint: I went to ?select and found a selection helper that allowed me to select those 9 columns without typing all their names\n\n# replace ... with relevant code\nmidwest_pop &lt;- midwest %&gt;% select(county, state, ...)\n\n\nFrom midwest_pop calculate the area of each county4. What’s the largest county in the midwest? How about in Illinois?\nFrom midwest_pop calculate percentage adults for each county. What county in the midwest has the highest proportion of adults? What’s county in the midwest has the lowest proportion of adults?\nHow many people live in Michigan?\nNote that together population density and population can give you information about the area (geographic size) of a location. What’s the total area of Illinois? You probably have no idea what the units are though. If you google, you’ll find that it doesn’t align perfectly with online sources. Given the units don’t align with other sources, can this data still be useful?\n\nWell done!

    "text": "Lab 7\nIn this lab, you will work with data_traffic.csv.\n\nGeneral Guidelines:\nYou will encounter a few functions we did not cover in the lecture video. This will give you some practice on how to use a new function for the first time. You can try following steps:\n\nStart by typing ?new_function in your Console to open up the help page\nRead the help page of this new_function. The description might be too technical for now. That’s OK. Pay attention to the Usage and Arguments, especially the argument x or x,y (when two arguments are required)\nAt the bottom of the help page, there are a few examples. Run the first few lines to see how it works\nApply it in your lab questions\n\nIt is highly likely that you will encounter error messages while doing this lab Here are a few steps that might help get you through it.\n\nLocate which line is causing this error first\nCheck if you may have a typo in the code. Sometimes another person can spot a typo faster than you.\nIf you enter the code without any typo, try googling the error message\nScroll through the top few links see if any of them helps\nTry working on the next few questions while waiting for answers by TAs\n\n\n\nBackground and Data\nRead the background and data section before lab.\n\nFollow the tweet thread and you’ll see how Professor Damon Jones, of Harris, prepares and analyzes his data. In this lab, you’re going to follow his lead and dig into traffic stop data from the University of Chicago Police Department, one of the largest private police forces in the world.\n\n\nWarm-up\n\nOpen a new Rmd and save it in your coding lab folder; if you downloaded the data, move your data file to your preferred data location.\nIn your Rmd, write code to load your packages. If you load packages in the console, you will get an error when you knit because knitting starts a fresh R session.\nLoad data_traffic.csv and assign it to the name traffic_data. This data was scrapped from the UCPD website and partially cleaned by Prof. Jones.\nRecall that group_by() operates silently. Below I create a new data frame called grouped_data.\n\n\ngrouped_data &lt;- traffic_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Race, Gender)\n\n\n\nHow can you tell grouped_data is different from traffic_data?\n\n\nHow many groups (Race-Gender pairs) are in the data? (This information should be available without writing additional code!)\n\n\nWithout running the code, predict the dimensions (number of rows by number of columns) of the tibbles created by traffic_data %&gt;% summarize(n = n()) and grouped_data %&gt;% summarize(n = n()).\n\n\nNow check you intuition by running the code.\n\n\n\nUse group_by() and summarize() to recreate the following table.\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  Race                                       n\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                  &lt;int&gt;\n1 African American                        3278\n2 American Indian/Alaskan Native            12\n3 Asian                                    226\n4 Caucasian                                741\n5 Hispanic                                 217\n6 Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander     4\n\n\n\nUse count() to produce the same table.\n\n\n\nMoving beyond counts\n\nRaw counts are okay, but frequencies (or proportions) are easier to compare across data sets. Add a column with frequencies and assign the new tibble to the name traffic_stop_freq. The result should be identical to Prof. Jones’s analysis on twitter.\n\nTry on your own first. If you’re not sure how to add a frequency though, you could google “add a proportion to count with tidyverse” and find this stackoverflow post. Follow the advice of the number one answer. The green checkmark and large number of upvotes indicate the answer is likely reliable.\n\nThe frequencies out of context are not super insightful. What additional information do we need to argue the police are disproportionately stopping members of a certain group? (Hint: Prof. Jones shares the information in his tweets.)\nFor the problem above, your groupmate tried the following code. Explain why the frequencies are all 1.\n\n\ntraffic_stop_freq_bad &lt;- traffic_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Race) %&gt;% \n  summarize(n = n(),\n            freq = n / sum(n)) \n\ntraffic_stop_freq_bad\n\nNow we want to go a step further. Do outcomes differ by race? In the first code block below, I provide code so you can visualize disposition by race. “Disposition” is police jargon that means the current status or final outcome of a police interaction.\n\ncitation_strings &lt;- c(\"citation issued\", \"citations issued\",\n                      \"citation issued\" )\n\narrest_strings &lt;- c(\"citation issued, arrested on active warrant\",\n                    \"citation issued; arrested on warrant\",\n                    \"arrested by cpd\", \"arrested on warrant\",\n                    \"arrested\",\"arrest\")\n\ndisposition_by_race &lt;- traffic_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(Disposition = str_to_lower(Disposition),\n         Disposition = case_when(Disposition %in% citation_strings ~ \"citation\",\n                                 Disposition %in% arrest_strings ~ \"arrest\",\n                                 TRUE ~ Disposition)) %&gt;%\n  count(Race, Disposition) %&gt;% group_by(Race) %&gt;%\n  mutate(freq = round(n / sum(n), 3))\n\ndisposition_by_race %&gt;%\n  filter(n &gt; 5, Disposition == \"citation\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = freq, x = Race)) + geom_col() +\n  labs(y = \"Citation Rate Once Stopped\", x = \"\", title = \"Traffic Citation Rate\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down how we got to this code. First, I ran traffic_data %&gt;% count(Race, Disposition) and noticed that we have a lot of variety in how officers enter information into the system. I knew I could deal with some of the issue by standardizing capitalization.\n\n\nIn the console, try out str_to_lower(...) by replacing the … with different strings. The name may be clear enough, but what does str_to_lower() do?\n\n\nAfter using mutate with str_to_lower(), I piped into count() again and looked for strings that represent the same Disposition. I stored terms in character vectors (e.g. citation_strings). The purpose is to make the case_when() easier to code and read. Once I got that right, I added frequencies to finalize disposition_by_race.\n\nTo make the graph, I first tried to get all the disposition data on the same plot.\n\n\n disposition_by_race %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = freq, x = Race, fill = Disposition)) + \n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the bar graph is stacked. Look at the resulting graph and discuss the pros and cons of this plot.\n\nI decided I would focus on citations only and added the filter(n &gt; 5, Disposition == \"citation\") to the code. What is the impact of filtering based on n &gt; 5? Would you make the same choice? This question doesn’t have a “right” answer. You should try different options and reflect.\nNow, you can create a similar plot based called “Search Rate” using the Search variable. Write code to re-produce this plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell done! You’ve learned how to conduct grouped analysis using real-world data!\nWant to improve this tutorial? Report any suggestions/bugs/improvements on here! We’re interested in learning from you how we can make this tutorial better."

Not really!\n\n1a. Round unemployment_rate: We create a new variable with the mutate function. In this case, we’re overwriting the existing unemployment_rate variable, by rounding it to 1 decimal places. Incomplete code is given below to guide you in the right direction, however you will need to fill in the blanks.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads&lt;- college_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  arrange(unemployment_rate) %&gt;%\n  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate) %&gt;%\n  mutate(unemployment_rate = ___(___, 1))\n\nWhile were making some changes, let’s change sharewomen to numeric (it appears to be a string). Make sure to save your changes by overwriting the existing data frame!\n\ncollege_recent_grads &lt;- college_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  mutate(sharewomen = as.numeric(___))\n\n\n\nWhich major has the highest percentage of women?\nTo answer such a question we need to arrange the data in descending order. For example, if earlier we were interested in the major with the highest unemployment rate, we would use the following:\nThe desc function specifies that we want unemployment_rate in descending order.\n\ncollege_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(unemployment_rate)) %&gt;%\n  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate)\n\n# A tibble: 173 × 3\n    rank major                                      unemployment_rate\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     6 Nuclear Engineering                                    0.177\n 2    90 Public Administration                                  0.159\n 3    85 Computer Networking And Telecommunications             0.152\n 4   171 Clinical Psychology                                    0.149\n 5    30 Public Policy                                          0.128\n 6   106 Communication Technologies                             0.120\n 7     2 Mining And Mineral Engineering                         0.117\n 8    54 Computer Programming And Data Processing               0.114\n 9    80 Geography                                              0.113\n10    59 Architecture                                           0.113\n# … with 163 more rows\n\n\n\n1b. Using what you’ve learned so far, arrange the data in descending order with respect to proportion of women in a major, and display only the major, the total number of people with major, and proportion of women. Show only the top 3 majors by adding head(3) at the end of the pipeline.\n\n\n#code here\n\n\n\nHow do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\nA percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: Wikipedia\nThere are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: p25th, median, and p75th. These correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.\nThe question we want to answer “How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?”. We need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by major_category. Then, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups. This decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions. So first, we need to visualize the data.\n\n1c.Let’s start simple and take a look at the distribution of all median incomes using geom_histogram, without considering the major categories.\n\n\nggplot(data = ____,\n       mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n1d. Try binwidths of \\(1000\\) and \\(5000\\) and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice.\n\n\nggplot(data = ___,\n       mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = ___)\n\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function:\n\ncollege_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n    min    max   mean   med     sd    q1    q3\n  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 22000 110000 40151. 36000 11470. 33000 45000\n\n\n\n1e. Based on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous 1e, determine which of these summary statistics above (min, max, mean, med, sd, q1, q3) is/are useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description and include the summary statistic output as well.You can pick single/multiple statistics and briefly explain why you pick it/them.\n1f. Next, we facet the plot by major category. Plot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in 1e.\n\n\nggplot(data = ___,\n       mapping = aes (x=median)) +\n  geom_histogram(bindwidth = 5000) +\n  facet_wrap(.~major_category)\n\n\n1g. Use filter to find out which major has the highest median income? lowest? Which major has the median() median income? Hint: refer to the statistics in 1d.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  ____(median == ____) \n\n\n1h. Which major category is the most popular in this sample? To answer this question we use a new function called count, which first groups the data , then counts the number of observations in each category and store the counts into a column named n. Add to the pipeline appropriately to arrange the results so that the major with the highest observations is on top.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  count(major_category) %&gt;% \n  ___(___(n))\n\n\n\nWhat types of majors do women tend to major in?\nFirst, let’s create a new vector called stem_categories that lists the major categories that are considered STEM fields.\n\nstem_categories &lt;- c(\"Biology & Life Science\",\n                     \"Computers & Mathematics\",\n                     \"Engineering\",\n                     \"Physical Sciences\")\n\nThen, we can use this to create a new variable in our data frame indicating whether a major is STEM or not.\n\ncollege_recent_grads &lt;- college_recent_grads %&gt;%\n  mutate(major_type = ifelse(major_category %in% \n                               stem_categories, \"stem\", \"not stem\"))\n\nLet’s unpack this: with mutate we create a new variable called major_type, which is defined as \"stem\" if the major_category is in the nector called stem_categories we created earlier, and as \"not stem\" otherwise.\n\n1i. Create a scatterplot of median income vs. proportion of women in that major, colored by whether the major is in a STEM field or not. Describe the association between these three variables.\n\n\nggplot(data = ___, \n       mapping = aes(x=median, \n           y= sharewomen, \n           color=major_type)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n1j.. We can use the logical operators to also filter our data for STEM majors whose median earnings is less than median for all majors’s median earnings, which we found to be $36,000 earlier. Your output should only show the major name and median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile earning for that major and should be sorted such that the major with the lowest median earning is on top.\n\n\n#code here\n\nWell done!

    "section": "Cross-validation",
    "text": "Cross-validation\nCross-validation is a method that works by holding out a subset of the training observations from the model fitting process, and then applying the model to those held out observations.\n\nThe Validation Set Approach\nThis is the type of cross-validation method we have been using in review sessions so far. It involves randomly dividing the available set of observations into two parts, a training set and a validation set. The model is fit on the training set, and the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in the validation set. The validation error rate provides an estimate of the test error rate.\nThe validation set approach is simple and is easy to implement, but it has a few drawbacks. First, it can yield estimates of the test error rate that are highly variable. In addition, since it trains the model using only a subset of the data, it may tend to overestimate the test error rate for the model fit on the entire data set.\n\n\nLeave-one-out Cross-validation\nLeave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) attempts to address the drawbacks of the validation set method. Instead of creating two subsets, a single observation is used for the validation set, and the remaining (\\(n - 1\\)) observations constitute the training set. The statistical learning method is fit on the \\(n - 1\\) training observations, and a prediction is made for the excluded observation to estimate a test error rate. The procedure is repeated \\(n\\) times, by selecting each individual observation for the validation data, training the procedure on the \\(n - 1\\) observations, and computing the test error. The LOOCV estimate for the test error is the average of these \\(n\\) test error estimates.\nCompared to the validation set approach, LOOCV is more expensive to implement. However, it has less bias since it uses almost all the training observations and yields estimates of the test error rate that are less variable through its averaging feature.\n\n\n\\(k\\)-fold Cross-validation\n\\(k\\)-fold Cross-validation is an alternative to LOOCV. For \\(j=1,...,k\\), the model is fit on all folds except fold \\(j\\). Then, the model’s predictive performance on the data is assessed in fold \\(j\\). Thus, for a given iteration, the “training” data is data from all the folds except for fold \\(j\\), and the ``test’’ data is data from fold \\(j\\). This process is repeated for \\(j=1,...,k\\) and a test error is estimated for each fold. The \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation estimate for the test error is the average of these \\(k\\) test error estimates.\nLOOCV can be thought of as a special type \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation, where \\(k\\) equals the number of observations in the data. In practice, one typically performs \\(k\\)-fold CV using \\(k = 5\\) or \\(k = 10\\), which provides computational advantage over \\(k = n\\). Beyond computational issues, LOOCV has lower bias but higher variance (why?), compared to \\(k\\)-fold CV with \\(k &lt; n\\). Overall, \\(k\\)-fold CV tends to win in terms of the bias-variance trade-off."

    "text": "Bootstrapping\nBootstrapping involves resampling a data set with replacement. It is a very useful statistical tool that allows one to quantify the uncertainty of an estimator, such as a coefficient. This is especially useful for models where there is not a convenient standard error formula. When the goal is to estimate the uncertainty of an estimate, one can bootstrap the data and generate the estimate many times (e.g. 1,000 times). Then, one can look at the distribution of the estimates and take the middle 95% as the 95% confidence interval.\nBootstrapping is also an important component of some very powerful machine learning models. We will learn about some of these models in the next few weeks."

A model that overfits has high variance, whereas a model that underfits has low variance.\nTo remember the difference between low variance and high variance models, I find it helpful to think of examples. Suppose your model was ``use the mean of the training data as the predicted value for all new data points.’’ The mean shouldn’t change much across training sets, so this has low variance. On the other hand, a model that picked up super complex patterns is likely to be picking up noise in addition to signal. The noise will vary by training set, so such a method would have high variance.\nThe bias of a statistical learning method is the error produced by representing a real world problem by a statistical learning method. Very flexible models (which are prone to overfitting) can capture complex patterns and so tend to have low bias. Very simple models (which are prone to underfitting) are limited in their ability to pick up patterns and so may have high bias.\nThe book uses the example of representing a non-linear function by a linear one to show that no matter how much data you have, a linear model will not do a great prediction job when the process generating the data is non-linear. Bias also applies to methods that might not fit your traditional concept of a statistical function. In the K-Nearest Neighbors section, we will discuss bias in that setting.\nOften, we will talk about the bias-variance trade-off. In an ideal world, we would find a model that has low variance and low bias, because that would yield a good and consistent model. In practice, you usually have to allow bias to increase in order to decrease variance and vice versa. However, there are many models that will decrease one (bias or variance) significantly while only increasing the other a little.\n\n\n\nSupervised learning refers to problems where there is a known outcome. In these problems, you can train a model to take features and predict the known outcome.\nUnsupervised learning refers to problems where you are interested in uncovering patterns and do not have a target outcome in mind.\nAn example of supervised learning would be using students’ high school grades, class enrollments, and demographic variables to predict whether or not they attend college.\nAn example of unsupervised learning would be using the same grades, enrollment, and demographic features to identify ``types’’ of high school students. That is, students who look similar according to these features. Perhaps you are interested in this because you want to make classes that contain a mix of different types of students. Often, unsupervised learning is useful for creating features for supervised learning problems, but sometimes uncovering patterns is the final objective.\n\n\n\nThere are different functions you can use to measure model performance, and which function you choose depends on your data and your objective. These functions are called ``loss functions,’’ which is a somewhat intuitive name when you think about the fact that your machine learning algorithm is trying to minimize this function and thus minimize your loss.\nTo understand how and why loss functions depend on your data and objectives, examples can be helpful.\nConsider first that you are trying to predict the future college majors of this year’s incoming freshmen (a classification problem). In this case, your prediction will either be right (you predict the major they end up choosing) or it will be wrong. Therefore, you might use accuracy (% correct) to measure model performance.\nWhat if, though, you cared more about being wrong for some majors than others? For example, imagine that all biology majors are going to need personalized lab equipment in their junior year and that the lab equipment is really expensive if ordered last minute but a lot cheaper if ordered a year or more in advance? Then, you might want to give more weight to people who end up being biology majors so that your model does better for predicting biology majors than other majors.\nNow consider that you are trying to predict home prices (a regression problem). You might measure your performance using mean-squared error (MSE), which is found by taking the difference between the predicted sale price for each home and the true sale price (the error), squaring it for each home, and then taking the mean of these squared errors. However, home prices are skewed (e.g. some homes are extremely expensive compared to most homes on the market). This means that a 5% error on a $3 million home is a lot bigger than a 5% error on a $100,000 home. When you square the errors (as you do when calculating MSE), the difference becomes enormous.\nBut since both errors are 5%, maybe you want to penalize them the same. One option is to use Mean Percentage Error (MPE), but this has the weird effect that if you over-predict one home by 5% and under-predict the other by 5%, your MPE is zero. Therefore, a popular option is to use the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which is the mean of the absolute values of the percentage errors and thus would be 5% in this example.\nFor many prediction problems in the policy sphere, we may not only care about accuracy of prediction but also about fairness or other objectives. The loss function is a place where we can explicitly tell the model to optimize for these concerns in addition to predictive performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea underlying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is that we expect observations with similar features to have similar outcomes. KNN makes no other assumptions about functional form, so it is quite flexible.\n\n\n\nKNN can be used for either regression or classification, though it works slightly differently depending on what setting we are in. In the classification setting, the prediction is a majority vote of the observation’s \\(K\\)-nearest neighbors. In the regression setting, the prediction is the average outcome of the observation’s \\(K\\)-nearest neighbors.\nFor KNN, bias will be lower when \\(K\\) is lower. Bias will increase quickly as k increases, with further away neighbors being included in the prediction.\nThe only choice we have to make when implementing KNN is the value of \\(K\\) (e.g. how many neighbors should we use in our prediction?). A good way to find \\(K\\) is through cross-validation, something we will cover a little later, but which broadly involves training the algorithm on one set of data and seeing how well it does on a different set.\n\n\n\nA concern with KNN is whether you have good coverage of your feature space. Imagine that all of your training points were in one region of the feature space, but some of your test points are far away from this region. You will still use the \\(K\\) nearest neighbors to predict the outcome for these far-away test points, but it might not work as well as if the points were close together. Therefore, when implementing KNN, it’s good to think about how similar the features in your test set will be to the features in your training set. If they differ systematically, that is a concern (as it would be for other ML methods as well).\nAnother important consideration is whether there is an imbalance in the frequency of one outcome compared to another. For example, suppose we are trying to classify points as true'' orfalse’’ and most points are true.'' Even if thefalse’’ outcomes are clustered together in the feature space, if we use a large enough value of \\(K\\), we will predict true'' for these observations simply because there are many moretrue’’ observations than ``false’’ observations. Therefore, we would do better to use a small value for \\(K\\) in this setting.\nAnother consideration is whether proximity in each variable is equally important or if proximity in one variable is more important than proximity in another variable. KNN will normalize variables so that they are all on the same scale (same mean and variance) and then treat distance in all normalized variables the same. If you want to up-weight proximity for some variables and down-weight it for others, you can change the way each variable is normalized to accomplish this. Alternatively, you can include only those variables you think are important. When you have this type of uncertainty, there are more principled ways of selecting variables that will be discussed later in the course.\n\n\n\nYou might think that neighbors that are really close should be weighted more than neighbors that are a bit further away. Many people agree, so there are methods to allow you to weight different observations differently. You might also think that you shouldn’t use just the \\(K\\) nearest neighbors, but all the neighbors within a certain distance. Or maybe you think there’s information available in all observations, but there’s more information in closer neighbors. All of these adjustments fall under the umbrella of kernel regression. In fact, KNN is a special case of kernel regression. Broadly defined, kernel regression methods are a class of methods that generate predictions by taking weighted averages of observations. Because these methods (KNN included) do not specify a functional form, they are called ``non-parametric regression’’ methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear regression is a parametric model that is additive and linear in the provided features. It is a classic technique used in many fields, and its widespread popularity greatly pre-dates the popularity of machine learning. Its general form is\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}X\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) is a vector of predicted \\(y\\) values and \\(X\\) is a matrix whose rows correspond to observations and whose columns correspond to features.\nWhen there is only one feature on the right hand side, the model is called a simple linear regression.\" When there are multiple features on the right hand side, the model is calledmultiple linear regression.”\nWhen used for inference, we are interested in \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\). However, when used for prediction, we are only interested in \\(\\hat{y}\\), and we cannot say that the \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\)s reflect any sort of causal relationship between the features and the outcome. For more information on how to test the significance of regression coefficients, please see Chapter 3 of ISLR for a reference on \\(t\\)-tests (in the simple model) and \\(F\\)-tests (in the multivariate model).\n\n\n\nTo find the coefficients \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) in a linear regression, we find the value of \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) that minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS) in the training data. The classic formula for \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) uses matrix algebra and is \\[\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\beta} = (X^\\prime X)^{-1}X^\\prime y\n\\end{equation}\\] We will estimate \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) using statistical software.\nIt is worth noting that the traditional measure of fit for linear regression is \\(R^2\\), but \\(R^2\\) mechanically increases with the inclusion of additional features. Therefore, in the prediction setting, the \\(R^2\\) on the training data is less important than the mean squared error (MSE) on the test data.\n\n\n\nThere are a few things to watch out for as far as the features that you feed into a linear regression.\n\nThere must be fewer features than observations. Later in the semester, we will cover penalized regression methods that do variable selection to yield estimable linear models, even when the number of available features exceeds the number of observations. Common penalized regression methods are lasso and ridge regression.\nYou can use quantitative or qualitative features for the \\(X\\)s. When using qualitative features, generate indicator variables for all but one category. The omitted category will serve as the ``baseline,’’ meaning that the coefficients on the included categories can be thought of as the differential effect of being in that category compared to the baseline (omitted) one.\nThe reason you omit one category when making indicator variables is to avoid linear dependence. If all categories were represented, the indicator columns would all sum to 1, which would mean they were linearly dependent. More generally, you cannot have collinearity or multi-collinearity, which means you cannot have features that are (close to) perfectly correlated.\nYou can interact two features (e.g. create a feature that is the product of two other features), and such interactions are valid on categorical and continuous features. However, when you include an interaction, you should also include each of the features on their own as well. Interactions have intuitive appeal if you think there are synergies between two features in terms of their effect on \\(y\\).\nYou can exponentiate features and include the exponentiated features in your model. The resulting model is sometimes called polynomial regression and is appropriate when there appears to be a non-linear relationship between a feature and the outcome.\nCheck for influential points – those that are both outliers (they have an unusual or extreme \\(y\\) value) and high leverage (they have an unusual or extreme \\(x\\)), as these points can greatly influence the model fit. You may want to exclude them or at least check your model’s sensitivity to including them versus excluding them.\n\nIf you are interested in inference (e.g. looking at the \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\)s to understand a causal relationship), it is important to be aware of Omitted Variables Bias (OVB). OVB occurs when you have two correlated features that each have an effect on \\(y\\) but only one is included in the regression. In that case, the coefficient on the included feature is biased, because it is partially picking up the true effect of the feature on the outcome and is also partially picking up the effect of the omitted feature on the outcome (since the omitted feature is correlated with the included feature).\nAs an example of OVB, suppose \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are positively (but not perfectly) correlated. If they are also both positively correlated with \\(y\\), then when \\(X_2\\) is omitted from the regression, the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) will be higher than when both \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are included. This is because the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) will now pick up both the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(y\\) and part of the effect of \\(X_2\\) on \\(y\\) (since \\(X_1\\) is a proxy for \\(X_2\\) because the two features are positively correlated).\nWhen implementing linear regression, you should also take a look at your residuals and make sure there are no red flags:\n\nWhen you plot residuals, they should appear randomly scattered. Any non-linearity or patterns in the residuals suggest your model is not appropriate.\nLinear regression assumes residuals are uncorrelated. Evidence of correlated residuals indicates a problem with your model or your data that should be investigated.\nResiduals should have constant variance. If you plot your residuals and their variance seems to be a function of \\(x\\), then the errors are heteroskedastic (a fancy word for ``a function of \\(x\\)’’). In this case, traditional statistical measures of significance are invalid, but other valid methods are available.\n\n\n\n\nThe main difference of note between linear regression and KNN is that linear regression is a parametric model whereas KNN is a non-parametric model. There are a few general differences between parametric and non-parametric models that are worth noting\n\nNon-parametric models are more flexible whereas parametric models impose stronger assumptions\nWhen there is a small number of observations per feature, parametric models tend to outperform non-parametric models\n\nIn addition to the general differences between parametric and non-parametric models, a key difference between KNN and linear regression is that linear regression is quite simple to fit. In fact, it only requires estimation of a few \\(\\beta\\)s, whereas KNN is much more computationally intensive. Because of this simplicity, linear regression is also more interpretable than KNN."

One option is to use Mean Percentage Error (MPE), but this has the weird effect that if you over-predict one home by 5% and under-predict the other by 5%, your MPE is zero. Therefore, a popular option is to use the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which is the mean of the absolute values of the percentage errors and thus would be 5% in this example.\nFor many prediction problems in the policy sphere, we may not only care about accuracy of prediction but also about fairness or other objectives. The loss function is a place where we can explicitly tell the model to optimize for these concerns in addition to predictive performance."

    "text": "The idea underlying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is that we expect observations with similar features to have similar outcomes. KNN makes no other assumptions about functional form, so it is quite flexible.\n\n\n\nKNN can be used for either regression or classification, though it works slightly differently depending on what setting we are in. In the classification setting, the prediction is a majority vote of the observation’s \\(K\\)-nearest neighbors. In the regression setting, the prediction is the average outcome of the observation’s \\(K\\)-nearest neighbors.\nFor KNN, bias will be lower when \\(K\\) is lower. Bias will increase quickly as k increases, with further away neighbors being included in the prediction.\nThe only choice we have to make when implementing KNN is the value of \\(K\\) (e.g. how many neighbors should we use in our prediction?). A good way to find \\(K\\) is through cross-validation, something we will cover a little later, but which broadly involves training the algorithm on one set of data and seeing how well it does on a different set.\n\n\n\nA concern with KNN is whether you have good coverage of your feature space. Imagine that all of your training points were in one region of the feature space, but some of your test points are far away from this region. You will still use the \\(K\\) nearest neighbors to predict the outcome for these far-away test points, but it might not work as well as if the points were close together. Therefore, when implementing KNN, it’s good to think about how similar the features in your test set will be to the features in your training set. If they differ systematically, that is a concern (as it would be for other ML methods as well).\nAnother important consideration is whether there is an imbalance in the frequency of one outcome compared to another. For example, suppose we are trying to classify points as true'' orfalse’’ and most points are true.'' Even if thefalse’’ outcomes are clustered together in the feature space, if we use a large enough value of \\(K\\), we will predict true'' for these observations simply because there are many moretrue’’ observations than ``false’’ observations. Therefore, we would do better to use a small value for \\(K\\) in this setting.\nAnother consideration is whether proximity in each variable is equally important or if proximity in one variable is more important than proximity in another variable. KNN will normalize variables so that they are all on the same scale (same mean and variance) and then treat distance in all normalized variables the same. If you want to up-weight proximity for some variables and down-weight it for others, you can change the way each variable is normalized to accomplish this. Alternatively, you can include only those variables you think are important. When you have this type of uncertainty, there are more principled ways of selecting variables that will be discussed later in the course.\n\n\n\nYou might think that neighbors that are really close should be weighted more than neighbors that are a bit further away. Many people agree, so there are methods to allow you to weight different observations differently. You might also think that you shouldn’t use just the \\(K\\) nearest neighbors, but all the neighbors within a certain distance. Or maybe you think there’s information available in all observations, but there’s more information in closer neighbors. All of these adjustments fall under the umbrella of kernel regression. In fact, KNN is a special case of kernel regression. Broadly defined, kernel regression methods are a class of methods that generate predictions by taking weighted averages of observations. Because these methods (KNN included) do not specify a functional form, they are called ``non-parametric regression’’ methods."

    "text": "Linear regression is a parametric model that is additive and linear in the provided features. It is a classic technique used in many fields, and its widespread popularity greatly pre-dates the popularity of machine learning. Its general form is\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}X\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) is a vector of predicted \\(y\\) values and \\(X\\) is a matrix whose rows correspond to observations and whose columns correspond to features.\nWhen there is only one feature on the right hand side, the model is called a simple linear regression.\" When there are multiple features on the right hand side, the model is calledmultiple linear regression.”\nWhen used for inference, we are interested in \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\). However, when used for prediction, we are only interested in \\(\\hat{y}\\), and we cannot say that the \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\)s reflect any sort of causal relationship between the features and the outcome. For more information on how to test the significance of regression coefficients, please see Chapter 3 of ISLR for a reference on \\(t\\)-tests (in the simple model) and \\(F\\)-tests (in the multivariate model).\n\n\n\nTo find the coefficients \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) in a linear regression, we find the value of \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) that minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS) in the training data. The classic formula for \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) uses matrix algebra and is \\[\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\beta} = (X^\\prime X)^{-1}X^\\prime y\n\\end{equation}\\] We will estimate \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) using statistical software.\nIt is worth noting that the traditional measure of fit for linear regression is \\(R^2\\), but \\(R^2\\) mechanically increases with the inclusion of additional features. Therefore, in the prediction setting, the \\(R^2\\) on the training data is less important than the mean squared error (MSE) on the test data.\n\n\n\nThere are a few things to watch out for as far as the features that you feed into a linear regression.\n\nThere must be fewer features than observations. Later in the semester, we will cover penalized regression methods that do variable selection to yield estimable linear models, even when the number of available features exceeds the number of observations. Common penalized regression methods are lasso and ridge regression.\nYou can use quantitative or qualitative features for the \\(X\\)s. When using qualitative features, generate indicator variables for all but one category. The omitted category will serve as the ``baseline,’’ meaning that the coefficients on the included categories can be thought of as the differential effect of being in that category compared to the baseline (omitted) one.\nThe reason you omit one category when making indicator variables is to avoid linear dependence. If all categories were represented, the indicator columns would all sum to 1, which would mean they were linearly dependent. More generally, you cannot have collinearity or multi-collinearity, which means you cannot have features that are (close to) perfectly correlated.\nYou can interact two features (e.g. create a feature that is the product of two other features), and such interactions are valid on categorical and continuous features. However, when you include an interaction, you should also include each of the features on their own as well. Interactions have intuitive appeal if you think there are synergies between two features in terms of their effect on \\(y\\).\nYou can exponentiate features and include the exponentiated features in your model. The resulting model is sometimes called polynomial regression and is appropriate when there appears to be a non-linear relationship between a feature and the outcome.\nCheck for influential points – those that are both outliers (they have an unusual or extreme \\(y\\) value) and high leverage (they have an unusual or extreme \\(x\\)), as these points can greatly influence the model fit. You may want to exclude them or at least check your model’s sensitivity to including them versus excluding them.\n\nIf you are interested in inference (e.g. looking at the \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\)s to understand a causal relationship), it is important to be aware of Omitted Variables Bias (OVB). OVB occurs when you have two correlated features that each have an effect on \\(y\\) but only one is included in the regression. In that case, the coefficient on the included feature is biased, because it is partially picking up the true effect of the feature on the outcome and is also partially picking up the effect of the omitted feature on the outcome (since the omitted feature is correlated with the included feature).\nAs an example of OVB, suppose \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are positively (but not perfectly) correlated. If they are also both positively correlated with \\(y\\), then when \\(X_2\\) is omitted from the regression, the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) will be higher than when both \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are included. This is because the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) will now pick up both the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(y\\) and part of the effect of \\(X_2\\) on \\(y\\) (since \\(X_1\\) is a proxy for \\(X_2\\) because the two features are positively correlated).\nWhen implementing linear regression, you should also take a look at your residuals and make sure there are no red flags:\n\nWhen you plot residuals, they should appear randomly scattered. Any non-linearity or patterns in the residuals suggest your model is not appropriate.\nLinear regression assumes residuals are uncorrelated. Evidence of correlated residuals indicates a problem with your model or your data that should be investigated.\nResiduals should have constant variance. If you plot your residuals and their variance seems to be a function of \\(x\\), then the errors are heteroskedastic (a fancy word for ``a function of \\(x\\)’’). In this case, traditional statistical measures of significance are invalid, but other valid methods are available.\n\n\n\n\nThe main difference of note between linear regression and KNN is that linear regression is a parametric model whereas KNN is a non-parametric model. There are a few general differences between parametric and non-parametric models that are worth noting\n\nNon-parametric models are more flexible whereas parametric models impose stronger assumptions\nWhen there is a small number of observations per feature, parametric models tend to outperform non-parametric models\n\nIn addition to the general differences between parametric and non-parametric models, a key difference between KNN and linear regression is that linear regression is quite simple to fit. In fact, it only requires estimation of a few \\(\\beta\\)s, whereas KNN is much more computationally intensive. Because of this simplicity, linear regression is also more interpretable than KNN."

    "text": "Logistic regression\nNow, let’s say we are interested in using a logistic regression. For a base case, let’s try to predict default from the other available variables using logistic regression. To run logistic regression in R, use glm(), which requires three arguments: - 1st: Your formula (y ~ x1 + x2) - 2nd: Family = binomial tells it to use logistic regression - 3rd: You data, including both x and y columns.\nWe will train the model on the training data, make predictions for the test data using predict(), and measure performance with Accuracy.\n\nlogistic_default &lt;- glm(default ~ student + balance + income,\n                        family = binomial,\n                        data = train_data)\n\nTo view information about the logistic regression, including coefficients, use summary()\n\nsummary(logistic_default)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = default ~ student + balance + income, family = binomial, \n    data = train_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

We will use the head() function, which prints the first few values of the object inside the parentheses. If you want to change the number of observations that are printed to 100, you can use head(object, n = 100)\n\nhead(logistic_predict)\n\n        4350           18         6678         4788         9481         9994 \n5.133197e-04 2.176129e-04 2.515555e-03 3.317590e-02 2.508148e-05 4.935658e-03 \n\n\nWe see that the prediction outputs are probabilities, so in order to make predictions we have to decide on a decision rule. A common one is if the predicted probability is &gt; 0.5, predict 1 otherwise 0. Let’s see how we would do using this rule. Because it’s a classification problem, accuracy is a good measure (% correct)\n\nclass_predictions &lt;- as.numeric(logistic_predict &gt; 0.5)\nlogistic_accuracy &lt;- mean(class_predictions == test_data$default)\nprint(logistic_accuracy)\n\n[1] 0.9745\n\n\nThe accuracy looks great! But, we might care more about different types of errors than overall error rate. For example, we may not want to give loans to people who will default even if this means denying loans to some people who wouldn’t default. We can measure error rate by true default status. Note that for defaulters, default = 1. Here, I pull out all the predictions for the true defaulters and see what fraction of those equal 1.\n\ntrue_pos_accuracy &lt;- mean(class_predictions[which(test_data$default == 1)] == 1)\nprint(true_pos_accuracy)\n\n[1] 0.3333333\n\n\nLike-wise for the non-defaulters, I see what fraction of those equal 0. This gives class-specific accuracy rates.\n\ntrue_neg_accuracy &lt;- mean(class_predictions[which(test_data$default == 0)] == 0)\nprint(true_neg_accuracy)\n\n[1] 0.9974107\n\n\nThese values summarise what can also be seen in the following table. Where the columns correspond to the true values and the rows correspond to the predicted values.\n\ntable(class_predictions, test_data$default)\n\n                 \nclass_predictions    0    1\n                0 1926   46\n                1    5   23\n\n\nSuppose instead of the accuracy, you wanted to directly calculate the error rate. How would you do it? Hint, errors are ones where the prediction does not equal the true value. In R, we use != for “does not equal”\nWe can also calculate the error rate for the true defaulters and non-defaulters.\n\ntrue_pos_error &lt;- mean(class_predictions\n                       [which(test_data$default == 1)] != 1)\nprint(true_pos_error)\n\n[1] 0.6666667\n\ntrue_neg_error &lt;- mean(class_predictions\n                       [which(test_data$default == 0)] != 0)\nprint(true_neg_error)\n\n[1] 0.002589332\n\n\nWe see that we did a lot better on the true negatives than the true positives. Among all the people who will default, we only predicted about 1/3% of them would default. If we want to do a better job identifying these people, we can do this by lowering the default threshold from a predicted probability of 0.5 to something lower, say 0.2. Note, though, that lowering this threshold means increasing the number of default predictions for people who don’t default as well. Since we aren’t really sure how low we want to make this threshold, we can try for a bunch of threshold values and then see how the performance changes to pick the one that is best for our setting. This involves domain knowledge, such as the cost of default and the earnings on loans extended to people who repay, so there’s not one right answer, but we can more clearly see the tradeoffs by trying many values and plotting the error rates in each group as a function of the threshold.\nTo do this, we can use a loop to try a bunch of threshold values and then calculate the error rates for each threshold. We can then plot the error rates as a function of the threshold to see how the error rates change as we change the threshold.\n\n## First, we need to specify the list of threshold values to assess\nthreshold_values &lt;- seq(from = 0.00, to = 0.50, by = 0.01)\n\nThen we initialize a matrix of error rates. This matrix will have a number of rows corresponding to the length of the list of threshold values and 2 columns corresponding to the true positive and true negative accuracy for each value that we test\n\nerror_rates &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = length(threshold_values), ncol = 2)\n\nNow we can start the loop. We initialize a tracker for the row index, then for each threshold value in our specified list of values, we update the tracker to reflect the row, generate the predicted classes using the specific threshold, calculate the true positive accuracy, calculate the true negative accuracy, and add the results to our matrix.\n\nindx &lt;- 0\n\nfor(threshold in threshold_values) {\n  \n  ## Update the tracker to reflect the row\n  indx &lt;- indx + 1\n  \n  ## Then generate the predicted classes using the specific threshold\n  class_predictions &lt;- as.numeric(logistic_predict &gt; threshold)\n  \n  ## Then calculate the true positive accuracy\n  true_pos_accuracy &lt;- mean(class_predictions[which(test_data$default == 1)] == 1)\n  \n  ## Then calculate the true negative accuracy\n  true_neg_accuracy &lt;- mean(class_predictions[which(test_data$default == 0)] == 0)\n  \n  ## Now we can add the results to our matrix \n  error_rates[indx,] &lt;- c(true_pos_accuracy, true_neg_accuracy)\n}\n\nLet’s plot each of these as a function of the threshold\n\nmatplot(x = threshold_values,\n        y = error_rates, \n        type = \"l\",\n        col = 3:4,\n        xlab = \"Threshold\",\n        ylab = \"Accuracy\",\n        main = \"Accuracy as a Function of Threshold\")\n        legend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Defaulters\", \"Non-defaulters\"), \n               col = 3:4, pch = 1)"

Note: although this is a binary variable, ridge and lasso are regression algorithms – regression can often give you a good sense of the ordinal distribution of likelihood that the outcome will be 1 even if the resulting value cannot be viewed as a probability). When you run lasso and ridge, you will need to provide a penalty parameter.

First, we will use principle components regression. Principle components regression does a linear regression but instead of using the X-variables as predictors, it uses principle components as predictors. The optimal number of principle components to use for PCR is usually found through cross-validation. To run PCR, we will use the package pls.\n\nlibrary(pls)\n\n## Try running PCR\npcr_fit  &lt;- pcr(logwage ~ ., data = wage_data[train,],          \n                scale = TRUE, validation = \"CV\")\n\nError in La.svd(X) : infinite or missing values in 'x'\nSometime you can get an error message. This error is because some of our variables have almost zero variance. Usually, variables with near-zero variance are indicator variables we generated for a rare event. Think about what happens to these predictors when the data are split into cross-validation/bootstrap sub-samples: if a few uncommon unique values are removed from one sample, the predictors could become zero-variance predictors which would cause many models to not run. We can figure out which variables have such low variance to determine how we want to handle them. The simplest approach to identify them is to set a manual threshold (which can be adjusted: 0.05 is a common choice).

    "section": "LASSO and Ridge Regression",
    "text": "LASSO and Ridge Regression\n\nConcept\nLeast Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Ridge Regression both fall under a broader class of models called shrinkage models. Shrinkage models regularize or penalize coefficient estimates, which means that they shrink the coefficients toward zero. Shrinking the coefficient estimates can reduce their variance, so these methods are particularly useful for models where we are concerned about high variance (i.e. over-fitting), such as models with a large number of predictors relative to the number of observations.\nBoth LASSO and Ridge regression operate by adding a penalty to the normal OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) minimization problem. These penalties can be thought of as a budget, and sometimes the minimization problem is explicitly formulated as minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) subject to a budget constraint. The idea of the budget is if you have a small budget, you can only afford a little “total” \\(\\beta\\), where the definition of “total” \\(\\beta\\) varies between LASSO and Ridge, but as your budget increases, you get closer and closer to the OLS \\(\\beta\\)s.\nLASSO and Ridge regression differ in exactly how they penalize the coefficients. In particular, LASSO penalizes the coefficients using an \\(L_1\\) penalty:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\n    y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j x_{ij}\n    \\right)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j| = RSS + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\n\\]\nRidge regression penalizes the coefficients using an \\(L_2\\) penalty:\n\\[\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\n    y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j x_{ij}\n    \\right)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2 = RSS + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2\n\\] You may notice that both the LASSO and Ridge Regression minimization problems feature a parameter \\(\\lambda\\). This is a tuning parameter that dictates how much we will penalize the “total” coefficients. Tuning parameters appear in many models and get their name from the fact that we tune (adjust / choose) them in order to improve our model’s performance.\nSince LASSO and Ridge Regression are used when we are concerned about variance (over-fitting), it should come as no surprise that increasing \\(\\lambda\\) decreases variance. It can be helpful to contextualize the \\(\\lambda\\) size by realizing that \\(\\lambda=0\\) is OLS and \\(\\lambda =\\infty\\) results in only \\(\\beta_0\\) being assigned a non-zero value.\nAs we increase \\(\\lambda\\) from zero, we decrease variance but increase bias (the classic bias-variance tradeoff). To determine the best \\(\\lambda\\) (e.g. the \\(\\lambda\\) that will lead to the best out of sample predictive performance), it is common to use cross validation. A good function in R that trains LASSO and Ridge Regression models and uses cross-validation to select a good \\(\\lambda\\) is cv.glmnet(), which is part of the glmnet package.\n\n\nKey difference between LASSO and Ridge\nAs noted above, both LASSO and Ridge regression shrink the coefficients toward zero. However, the penalty in Ridge (\\(\\lambda \\beta_j^2\\)) will not set any of coefficients exactly to zero (unless \\(\\lambda =\\infty\\)). Increasing the value of \\(\\lambda\\) will tend to reduce the magnitudes of the coefficients (which helps reduce variance), but will not result in exclusion of any of the variables. While this may not impact prediction accuracy, it can create a challenge in model interpretation in settings where the number of features is large. This is an obvious disadvantage.\nOn the other hand, the \\(L_1\\) penalty of LASSO forces some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly equal to zero when the tuning parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is sufficiently large. Therefore, LASSO performs variable selection, much like best subset selection.\n\n\nImplementation and Considerations\nLASSO and Ridge Regression are useful models to use when dealing with a large number of predictors \\(p\\) relative to the number of observations \\(n\\). It is good to standardize your features so that coefficients are not selected because of their scale rather than their relative importance.\nFor example, suppose you were predicting salary, and suppose you had a standardized test score that was highly predictive of salary and you also had parents’ income, which was only somewhat predictive of salary. Since standardized test scores are measured on a much smaller scale than the outcome and than parents’ income, we would expect the coefficient on test scores to be large relative to the coefficient on parents’ income. This means it would likely be shrunk by adding the penalty, even though it reflects a strong predictive relationship.\n\n\nInterpreting Coefficients\nCoefficients produced by LASSO and Ridge Regression should not be interpreted causally. These methods are used for prediction, and as such, our focus is on \\(\\hat{y}\\). This is in contrast to an inference problem, where we would be interested in \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\).\nThe intuition behind why we cannot interpret the coefficients causally is similar to the intuition underlying Omitted Variables Bias (OVB). In OVB, we said that if two variables \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) were correlated with each other and with the outcome \\(Y\\), then the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) in a regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(X_1\\) would differ from the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) in a regression where \\(X_2\\) was also included. This is because since \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are correlated, when we omit \\(X_2\\), the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) picks up the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(Y\\) as well as some of the effect of \\(X_2\\) on \\(Y\\)."

We have not yet covered unsupervised learning, though we will in the second half of the semester. The important thing to know at this point about unsupervised learning is that unsupervised learning methods do not use labels \\(Y\\).\nPrincipal Components Analysis (PCA), therefore, does not use \\(Y\\) in determining the principal components. Instead, the principal components are determined solely by looking at the predictors \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\). Each principal component is a weighted sum of the original predictors \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\). For clarity of notation, we will use \\(Z\\) to represent principal components and \\(X\\) to represent predictors.\nPrincipal components are created in an ordered way. The order can be described as follows: If you had to project all of the data onto only one line, the first principal component defines the line that would lead to points being as spread out as possible (e.g. having highest variance). If you had to project all of the data onto only one plane, the plane defined by the first two principal components (which are orthogonal by definition) would be the plane where the points were as spread out as possible (e.g. highest possible variance).\nSince variance is greatly affected by measurement scale, it is common practice and a good idea to scale your variables, so that results are not driven by the scale on which the variables were measured.\nWhen estimating principal components, you will estimate \\(p\\) components, where \\(p\\) is the number of predictors \\(X\\). However, you usually only pay attention to / use the first few components, since the last few components capture very little variance. Note that you can exactly recover your original data when using all \\(p\\) components.\n\n\nPrincipal Components Regression\nPrincipal Components Regression (PCR) regresses the outcome \\(Y\\) on the principal components \\(Z_1\\),…,\\(Z_M\\), where \\(M&lt;p\\) and \\(p\\) is the number of predictors \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\).\nNote that the principal components \\(Z_1\\),…,\\(Z_M\\) were defined by looking only at \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\) and not at \\(Y\\). Putting the principal components into a regression is the first time we are introducing any interaction between the principal components and the outcome \\(Y\\).\nThe main idea of Principal Components Regression is that hopefully only a few components explain most of the variance in the predictors overall and as is relevant to the relationship between the predictors and the response. In other words, when we use PCR, we assume that the directions in which \\(X\\) shows the most variance are also the directions most associated with \\(Y\\). When this assumption is true, we are able to use \\(M&lt;&lt;p\\) (e.g. \\(M\\) much smaller than \\(p\\)) parameters while still getting similar in-sample performance and hopefully better out-of-sample performance (due to not overfitting) to a regression of \\(Y\\) on all \\(p\\) predictors. Although the assumption is not guaranteed to be true, it is often a good enough approximation to give good results.\nPCA is one example of dimensionality reduction, because it reduces the dimension of the problem from \\(p\\) to \\(M\\). Note, though, that dimensionality reduction is different from feature selection. We are still using all features; we have just aggregated them into principal components.\nThe exact number \\(M\\) of principal components to use in PCR (the regression of \\(Y\\) on the principal components) is usually determined by cross-validation.\n\n\nImplementation and Considerations\nWhen using PCR, there are a few things to pay attention to. First, be sure to standardize variables or else the first few principal components will favor features measured on larger scales. Second, the number of principal components to use in PCR is determined using cross-validation. If the number is high and close to the number of features in your data, the assumption that the directions in which the predictors vary most are also the directions that explain the relationship between the predictors and response is false. In such a case, other methods, such as ridge and lasso, are likely to perform better."

    "text": "Partial Least Squares\nPartial Least Squares is a supervised alternative to PCR. Recall that for PCR, the principal components \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\) were formed from the original features \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) without looking at \\(Y\\) (unsupervised).\nPartial Least Squares (PLS) also generates a new set of features \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\) but it uses the correlation between the predictors \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) and the outcome \\(Y\\) to determine the weights on \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) for each \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\). In this way, PLS attempts to find directions that explain both the response and the predictors.\nThe first feature \\(Z_1\\) is determined by weighting \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) proportional to each feature’s correlation with \\(Y\\). It then residualizes the predictors \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) by regressing them on \\(Z_1\\) and repeats the weighting procedure using the orthogonalized predictors. The process then repeats until we have \\(M\\) components, where \\(M\\) is determined by cross validation.\n\nImplementation and Considerations\nJust as with PCR, it’s best practice to scale the predictors before running PLS.\n\n\nComparison with PCR\nPLS directly uses \\(Y\\) in generating the features \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\). It then regresses \\(Y\\) on these features. Therefore, PLS uses \\(Y\\) twice in the process of estimating the model.\nIn contrast, PCR only looks at the outcome \\(Y\\) when estimating the final regression. The components are estimated without ``peeking’’ at \\(Y\\).\nBecause \\(Y\\) is used twice in PLS and only once in PCR, in practice PLS exhibits lower bias (e.g. is better able to fit the training data) but higher variance (e.g. is more sensitive to the exact training data). Therefore, the two methods generally have similar out-of-sample predictive power in practice."

    "text": "The Mathematical Compass\nBefore we dive into the practical applications, let’s lay the mathematical groundwork that underpins these techniques—a foundation as crucial to understanding their functionality as a compass is to navigation.\n\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A Non-Parametric Approach\nKNN’s beauty lies in its simplicity and the intuitive concept of “neighborliness.” It posits that data points with similar characteristics (features) are likely to share the same outcome. Whether we’re classifying flowers based on petal sizes or predicting housing prices from neighborhood characteristics, KNN asks, “Who are your nearest neighbors?”\n\nMathematical Intuition:\nFor a given data point, KNN looks at the ‘K’ closest points (neighbors) and makes a prediction based on their majority class (classification) or average value (regression). The distance between points—Euclidean, Manhattan, or any other metric—serves as the basis for determining “closeness.”\nTo elaborate on this with mathematical expressions and to visualize it within a coordinate plane, let’s dive deeper:\n\nDistance Metrics\nThe most common distance metric used in KNN is the Euclidean distance, which in a two-dimensional space can be expressed as:\n\\[d(p, q) = \\sqrt{(p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2}\\]\nwhere \\(p = (p_1, p_2)\\) and \\(q = (q_1, q_2)\\) are two points in the Euclidean plane.\nFor higher dimensions, the formula generalizes to:\n\\[d(p, q) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (p_i - q_i)^2}\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of dimensions (features) and \\(p_i\\), \\(q_i\\) are the coordinates of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) in each dimension.\n\n\nKNN Algorithm\n\nCompute Distance: Calculate the distance between the query instance and all the training samples.\nSort Distances: Order the training samples by their distance from the query instance.\nSelect K Nearest Neighbors: Identify the top \\(K\\) closest training samples.\nMajority Vote or Average: For classification, the predicted class is the most common class among the \\(K\\) nearest neighbors. For regression, it is the average of the values.\n\n\n\nDecision Boundary Visualization\nIn a 2D coordinate plane, imagine plotting various data points, each belonging to one of two classes. The decision boundary that KNN creates is not linear but forms curves that encircle clusters of points belonging to the same class. This can be visualized as follows:\n\nCreate a dense grid of points covering the entire plane.\nUse KNN to classify each point on the grid.\nColor the points differently based on the predicted class, revealing the decision boundary.\n\nThis boundary demarcates the regions of the plane where a query point would be classified as one class or the other. It’s worth noting that the shape of the boundary depends on \\(K\\) and the distance metric used.\n\n\nK Selection\nChoosing the right \\(K\\) is critical for the model’s performance. Too small a \\(K\\) leads to a highly complex model that may overfit, capturing noise in the training data. Conversely, too large a \\(K\\) simplifies the model excessively, potentially underfitting and missing key patterns.\n\\[K_{optimal} = \\text{argmin}_K (\\text{Error}(K))\\]\nThe optimal \\(K\\) minimizes the prediction error, which can be determined through cross-validation.\nBy understanding the mathematical foundations of KNN and visualizing its application in a coordinate plane, we can better appreciate its flexibility and the importance of distance metrics and \\(K\\) selection in shaping the decision boundaries."

    "text": "A Quick Note on Training and Testing Data\nOne of the pivotal steps in the machine learning workflow is the division of your dataset into training and testing sets. This practice is not just routine but foundational, ensuring that we evaluate our models accurately and fairly. But why do we take this step, and what does it achieve?\n\nCrafting and Validating Predictive Models\nThe essence of machine learning lies in learning from data and making predictions. When we train a model, we are essentially ‘teaching’ it to recognize patterns and make decisions based on historical data. However, the true test of a model’s mettle is not how well it memorizes the training data, but how effectively it can apply its learned knowledge to new, unseen data. This is where the concept of generalization comes into play.\n\n\nWhy Not Learn from All the Data?\nA natural question arises: if our goal is to make the best possible predictions, why not train our model on the entire dataset? The answer lies in the risk of overfitting. An overfitted model is akin to a student who memorizes facts for an exam rather than understanding the underlying concepts. Just as the student might struggle to apply their knowledge in real-world situations, an overfitted model performs well on its training data but poorly on any new data.\n\n\nTraining Set: The Learning Phase\nThe training set serves as the educational cornerstone for our model. It’s the data on which the model trains, learns patterns, and adjusts its parameters. For KNN, this involves storing the features and labels of the training examples to later find the nearest neighbors of unseen instances.\n\n\nTesting Set: The Examination Phase\nAfter training, we introduce the model to the testing set, a separate portion of the data withheld from the training phase. This step is the model’s exam—it’s where we assess its ability to generalize the patterns it learned during training to new examples. The performance on the testing set gives us a realistic estimate of how the model is expected to perform in real-world scenarios.\n\n\nThe Significance of the Split\nSplitting data into training and testing sets is a critical step that balances the need for a model to learn effectively and the necessity of evaluating its predictive power honestly. By adhering to this practice, we ensure that our models are tested in a manner that mimics their eventual use on new, unseen data, providing a reliable measure of their performance and generalization capability.\nEnd of note :)"

It’s about revising our assumptions with new data.\n\n\nAssumptions of LDA\nLDA makes a couple of key assumptions:\n\nNormal Distribution: It assumes that the data points for each class (like our apples and oranges) are normally distributed. This means if you plot the features (weight and diameter), they’ll form a bell curve, with most apples (or oranges) near the average, and fewer as you move away from the center.\nEqual Variance: LDA assumes that these bell curves for each class have the same shape, though they might be centered at different points. This is like saying, while apples and oranges might differ in average size and weight, the variation around their averages is similar.\n\n\n\nThe LDA Decision Rule\nLDA looks for a line (or in more complex cases, a plane or hyperplane) that best separates our classes (apples from oranges) based on their features. It calculates the means (averages) and variances (spread) for each class and then finds the line where the distance between the means is maximized relative to the variance.\nMathematically, this involves calculating a score (the discriminant score) for each data point that measures how far it is from each class’s mean, adjusted for the overall variance. Data points are then classified based on which score is higher, indicating which class they’re closer to."

    "text": "Putting LDA into Practice: Simulating Data in R\nNow, let’s see how this works in practice with our R example. We simulate two classes with distinct means but shared variances, plotting them to visualize the data. We will then fit an LDA model to the data and plot the decision boundary, which shows how LDA separates the two classes based on their features.\n\n# Simulate the data\n\nlibrary(MASS) # For lda() and mvrnorm()\nset.seed(100) # Ensure reproducibility\n\nmu1 &lt;- c(-1, 0) # Mean for class 1\nmu2 &lt;- c(1, 0)  # Mean for class 2\nSigma &lt;- matrix(c(2, 1, 1, 2), ncol = 2) # Same covariance matrix for both classes\n\n# Generate data\nclass1 &lt;- mvrnorm(n = 50, mu = mu1, Sigma = Sigma)\nclass2 &lt;- mvrnorm(n = 50, mu = mu2, Sigma = Sigma)\n\ndata &lt;- rbind(class1, class2)\nlabels &lt;- factor(c(rep(0, 50), rep(1, 50)))\ndata &lt;- data.frame(data, class = labels)\n\nWith the data simulated, we can plot it to visualize the distribution of the two classes:\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = X1, y = X2, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Plot of the Data\",\n       x = \"Feature 1\", y = \"Feature 2\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#0e4a6b', '#ed7b2e')) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Class\", override.aes = list(size = 3))) \n\n\n\n\nHaving visualized our data, we proceed to apply LDA to classify these points and find the decision boundary that best separates them:\n\n# Fit LDA model\nlda_fit &lt;- lda(class ~ ., data = data)\n\nWe can now visualize the decision boundary that LDA has learned from the data:\n\n# plot the decision boundary\nx &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 1000)\ny &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 1000)\ngrid &lt;- expand.grid(X1 = x, X2 = y)\ngrid$class &lt;- predict(lda_fit, newdata = grid)$class\n\nmeans &lt;- as.data.frame(lda_fit$means)\nmeans$class &lt;- factor(0:1)\nmeans$size &lt;- 5\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = X1, y = X2, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() + theme_minimal() +\n  geom_contour(data = grid, aes(x = X1, y = X2, z = as.numeric(class)), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data = means, aes(x = X1, y = X2), color = 'black', size = 8, shape=18) +\n  geom_point(data = means, aes(x = X1, y = X2, color = class), size = 6, shape=18) +\n  labs(title = \"LDA Decision Boundary\",\n       subtitle = \"Diamonds represent Class Means\",\n       x = \"Feature 1\", y = \"Feature 2\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#0e4a6b', '#ed7b2e')) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Class\", override.aes = list(size = 3))) \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Does This Mean?\nWhen we plot the decision boundary found by LDA, we’re seeing the line that best distinguishes between our classes based on the data. Points on one side of the line are more likely to be Class 0, and on the other, Class 1. The class means (marked as diamonds on our plot) help us visualize the centers around which our data clusters, and the decision boundary shows how LDA uses these centers to classify the data."

    "text": "How it Works\n\nStep 1: Standardization\nSuppose we have a dataset with \\(n\\) observations and \\(p\\) variables.\n\\[\nX = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{11} & x_{12} & \\cdots & x_{1p} \\\\ x_{21} & x_{22} & \\cdots & x_{2p} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \\cdots & x_{np} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, we standardize the data matrix \\(X\\) to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for each variable. This is crucial for ensuring that all variables contribute equally to the analysis.\nGiven a data matrix \\(X\\), the standardized value \\(z_{ij}\\) of each element is calculated as:\n\\[\nz_{ij} = \\frac{x_{ij} - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_j}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu_j\\) is the mean and \\(\\sigma_j\\) is the standard deviation of the \\(j^{th}\\) column of \\(X\\).\n\n\nStep 2: Covariance Matrix\nNext, we calculate the covariance matrix \\(C\\) from the standardized data matrix \\(Z\\). The covariance matrix reflects how variables in the dataset vary together.\nThe covariance matrix is calculated as:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{1}{n-1} Z^T Z\n\\]\nwhere \\(Z\\) is the standardized data matrix, and \\(n\\) is the number of observations.\n\n\nStep 3: Eigenvalue Decomposition\nThe eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix \\(C\\) is performed next. This step identifies the principal components of the dataset.\nFor the covariance matrix \\(C\\), we find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) and the corresponding eigenvectors \\(v\\) by solving:\n\\[\nCv = \\lambda v\n\\]\n\n\nStep 4: Selection of Principal Components\nThe principal components are selected based on the eigenvalues. The eigenvectors, corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, represent the directions of maximum variance in the data.\nBy selecting the top \\(k\\) principal components, we reduce the dimensionality of our data while retaining most of its variability.\n\n\nSummary\nPCA transforms the original data into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables, the principal components, ordered by the amount of variance they capture. This process allows for the simplification of data, making it easier to explore and visualize."

Our approach mirrors the methodical steps of a college textbook, focusing on clarity, precision, and practical insights.\n\nGenerating a Simulated Dataset\nFirst, let’s create a dataset that reflects the complexity often encountered in real data. Our simulated dataset includes:\n\nWe simulate 300 observations, ensuring a robust dataset for analysis.\nVariables \\(X1\\), \\(X2\\), and \\(X3\\) are created with varying degrees of noise, simulating real-world unpredictability. \\(X2\\) and \\(X3\\) are intentionally correlated with \\(X1\\) but with their unique twists of randomness.\nOur outcome variable y is a concoction of influences from \\(X1\\), \\(X2\\), and \\(X3\\), topped with its own layer of noise.\n\nHere’s the R code to generate this dataset:\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly) # For interactive 3D plotting\nlibrary(caret)  # For PCA and regression\nlibrary(GGally) # For ggpairs\nlibrary(ggfortify) \n\nset.seed(123) # Ensuring our pretend data is the same each time\n\n# Generate our dataset\nn &lt;- 300 # Number of observations\nX1 &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = 50, sd = 10)\nX2 &lt;- X1 + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 25) # More noise added\nX3 &lt;- X1 + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 10) # More noise added\ny &lt;- X1 + X2 + X3 + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 30) # Increase noise in the dependent variable\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(X1, X2, X3, y)\n\n\n\nVisualizing the Data\nBefore applying PCA, we visually explore the dataset to understand the relationships between variables. ggpairs provides a comprehensive pairwise comparison, offering initial insights into correlations and variability among our predictors and with the outcome variable.\n\n# Let's peek at the relationships\nggpairs(data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Visualization\nA 3D scatter plot further elucidates the interactions among predictors, allowing us to appreciate the dataset’s complexity beyond 2D limitations..\n\n# Interactive 3D plot to visualize relationships\nfig &lt;- plot_ly(data, x = ~X1, y = ~X2, z = ~X3, type = 'scatter3d', mode = 'markers',\n               marker = list(size = 5, opacity = 0.5))\nfig &lt;- fig %&gt;% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'X1'),\n                                   yaxis = list(title = 'X2'),\n                                   zaxis = list(title = 'X3')))\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\nIsn’t that cool? Visualizing data in 3D can offer insights that are not immediately obvious in 2D plots, providing a richer understanding of our dataset’s structure.\n\n\nSimplifying Complexity with PCA\nWith PCA, we aim to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality by identifying principal components that capture the most variance.

The process involves training a regression model on a simplified version of the training data, where simplification is achieved by reducing the data’s dimensions using PCA.\nProcess Overview\n\nSplit the Data: We begin by dividing our dataset into training and testing sets to prepare for a robust evaluation of the model’s predictive performance.\nApply PCA to the Training Data: PCA is performed on the training data to identify the principal components, which are the directions in the data that account for the most variance.\nTransform Both Training and Testing Data: The principal components obtained from the training data are then used to transform both the training and testing sets into the PCA space. This ensures that the model is trained and evaluated on data represented in the same reduced-dimensionality space.\nTrain the Model on Transformed Training Data: A regression model is trained using the PCA-transformed training data. This model aims to predict the outcome variable based on the reduced set of features (principal components).\nEvaluate the Model on Transformed Testing Data: The model’s predictive performance is assessed using the PCA-transformed testing data, allowing us to understand how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.\n\n\n# Splitting the dataset\ntrainingIndex &lt;- createDataPartition(data$y, p = .8, list = FALSE)\ntrainingData &lt;- data[trainingIndex, ]\ntestingData &lt;- data[-trainingIndex, ]\n\n# Performing PCA on training data\npca_train &lt;- prcomp(trainingData[,1:3], center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)\n\n# Transforming both training and testing data using the PCA model first 2 comps\ntrainingData_transformed &lt;- predict(pca_train, newdata = trainingData[,1:3])[,1:2]\ntestingData_transformed &lt;- predict(pca_train, newdata = testingData[,1:3])[,1:2]\n\n# Preparing data for modeling\ntrainingModelData &lt;- as.data.frame(trainingData_transformed)\ntrainingModelData$y &lt;- trainingData$y\n\n# Fitting the linear model on transformed training data\nmodel &lt;- lm(y ~ ., data = trainingModelData)\n\n# Summary of the model trained on PCA-transformed training data\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ ., data = trainingModelData)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-78.422 -24.126  -1.018  17.075  90.479 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "When using Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future’s history before merging it into the main branch.\nThere are many different use cases for branches ranging from the aforementioned “feature branches”, “release branches”, dev/test/qa branches, and more.\n\n\n\nWhen creating a new repository, git by default starts with a main branch which is what we have been using until now. When we create branches, we are branching off of the most recent commit on the main branch.\n\nThe diagram above visualizes a repository with two isolated lines of development, one for a little feature, and one for a longer-running feature. By developing them in branches, it’s not only possible to work on both of them in parallel, but it also keeps the main main branch free from questionable code.\nAfter developing a feature, it needs to be merged back into the main branch. We will do this using a Pull Request.\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating a branch, the head of the branch splits off of a common base as seen in the picture above. This is why we refer to Git as a non-linear workflow.

    "text": "When using Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future’s history before merging it into the main branch.\nThere are many different use cases for branches ranging from the aforementioned “feature branches”, “release branches”, dev/test/qa branches, and more."

When we create branches, we are branching off of the most recent commit on the main branch.\n\nThe diagram above visualizes a repository with two isolated lines of development, one for a little feature, and one for a longer-running feature. By developing them in branches, it’s not only possible to work on both of them in parallel, but it also keeps the main main branch free from questionable code.\nAfter developing a feature, it needs to be merged back into the main branch.

    "text": "Part IV: SSH\nIn order to write code locally on our computer and be able to push to GitHub (or pull from GitHub) daily without constantly having to enter a username and password each time, we’re going to set up SSH keys.\n\nSSH keys come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub, and a private key that is stored only on your computer. If the keys match, you’re granted access.\nThe cryptography behind SSH keys ensures that no one can reverse engineer your private key from the public one.\nsource: https://jdblischak.github.io/2014-09-18-chicago/novice/git/05-sshkeys.html\n\nThe following steps are a simplification of the steps found in GitHub’s documentation. If you prefer, feel free to follow the steps at that link. Otherwise, for a simplified experience continue on below!\nSimplified Setup Steps\n\nStep 1: Check to see if you already have keys.\nRun the following command.\nls -al ~/.ssh/\nIf you see any output, that probably means you already have a public and private SSH key. If you have keys, you will most likely you will have two files, one named id_rsa (that contains your private key) and id_rsa.pub (that contains your public key).\nsidenote: Those files may also be named something like: id_ecdsa.pub or id_ed25519.pub. That just means you’re using a different encryption algorithm to generate your keys. You can learn more about that here if you chose to. Or, don’t worry about it and power on!\nIf you already have keys, continue to step 3. Otherwise, read on!\nStep 2: Create new SSH keys.\nRun the following comamnd, but makes sure to replace your_email@example.com with your own email address. Use the same email address you used to sign up to GitHub with.\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\nYou may then see a prompt like the one below. Just hit enter to save the key in the default location.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/jacob/.ssh/id_rsa):\nAfter that, the system will prompt you to enter a passphrase. We’re not going to use a passphrase here, so just go ahead and leave that blank and hit enter twice.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nEnter same passphrase again:\nFinally you should see some randomart that looks like this\nYour identification has been saved in /Users/jacob/.ssh/id_rsa.\nYour public key has been saved in /Users/jacob/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\nThe key fingerprint is:\nSHA256:2AazdvCBP8d1li9tF8cszM2KbtjPe7iwfCK8gUgzIGY your_email@example.com\nThe key's randomart image is:\n+---[RSA 4096]----+\n|                 |\n|       .     o * |\n|  E . = .   . B.*|\n| o . . X o . + =o|\n|      B S o . o =|\n|     o * + +   o.|\n|      . ..o =  . |\n|          o+.=o .|\n|          .ooo=+ |\n+----[SHA256]-----+\nStep 3: Add your key to GitHub\nRun the following command to view your public key\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nNavigate to https://github.com/settings/keys and hit “New SSH key”. Paste the SSH key from the last command into the text box as shown below and then hit “Add SSH key”. Make sure you copy paste exactly. The key will likely start with ssh_rsa and end with your email address. You can give the key a title like “My Macbook Pro” so you know which computer this key comes from.\n\nStep 4: Verify that it worked!\nRun the following command to test your computer’s SSH connection to GitHub\nssh -T git@github.com\nIf the connection is successful, you will see a message like this\n&gt; Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not\n&gt; provide shell access.\n\n\nRecap: What did we just do?\nWe just created a public/private SSH Key pair. There is now a folder on your computer called .ssh (it is a hidden folder, hidden folders have names that start with .). You can run this command to see the files in that folder.\nls -al ~/.ssh/\nid_rsa.pub contains your public key, you can see what that looks like by running:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nid_rsa contains your private key, you can see what that looks like by running:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nThis public and private key pair are mathematically linked. As the name suggests, you can share your public key far and wide, but must keep your private key safe and secure. Since you have shared your public key with GitHub, your computer can encrypt files with your private key and send them to GitHub. Since GitHub has your public key, it can match that file and verify that it is coming from you. Your computer can now securely communicate with GitHub without needing a username and password every time.\nTo get started with Git, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the installer from the Git website. Once you have Git installed, you can use the git command in your terminal to interact with Git."

This study delves into the contrasting practices of batch-ordering multiple tests simultaneously versus the sequential ordering of tests based on previous results. Our analysis revealed stark differences in physician diagnostic approaches, even when working in similar environments. Findings suggest that physicians who predominantly make use of batching (“batchers”) tend to order more tests, which is associated with longer lengths of stay and increased costs. In contrast, other physicians (“non-batchers”) order fewer tests, which is associated with lower lengths of stay and costs, without any impact on primary ED outcome measures, such as the 72-hour rate of return.\n\n\n\nPDF Code Repo"

    "text": "Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. -Wikipedia\n\n\nGit is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. -GitHub (https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/)\n\n\n\nKeeping track of file versions is hard.\n\n\n\nAbove all else, Git is a fast and distributed version control system, that allows you to efficiently handle projects large and small.\nHere are some problems we face as developers, and how git solves them:\n\n\nGit allows us to make save points at any time. These save points are called ‘commits’. Once a save point is made, it’s permanent, and allows us to go back to that save point at any time. From there, we can see what the code looked like at that point, or even start building off that version.\n\n\n\n\nEvery commit has a description (commit message), which allows us to describe what changes were made between the current and previous commit. This is usually a description of what features were added or what bugs were fixed.\nAdditionally, git supports tagging, which allows us to mark a specific commit as a specific version of our code (e.g. ‘2.4.5’).\n\n\n\n\nIt’s often important to see content of the actual changes that were made.

This means that you can have multiple versions of a project or “branches” with different save points, or “commits”, simultaneously within the same folder and easily toggle bgttween them. You can split new branches off a project when you’re looking to experiment or implement a new feature, and you can merge those branches back into the main (formerly known as “master”) branch when you’re ready to incorporate them into a project.\n\n\n\n\nIn developing software, we often want to experiment in adding a feature or refactoring (rewriting) existing code.

    "text": "(Some of) GitHub’s Features\n\nThe README.md file\nGithub looks for a “readme” file and renders it as you’re navigating through the file structure. This is a great way to guide people through your code.\n\nReadme files are often given the .md extension, meaning they’re written in a language called markdown that allows for nicer formatting. You can check out this markdown cheet sheet (https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) if you want to see how formatting works, but you can also save a readme files as plain text. Github will also detect .txt files, or you can just write plain text inside your .md file.\n\n\nCommit Log\n\nVocab\n\ncommit - the basic unit of a git repository is a commit. It is a set of changes to a file. A commit usually comes with an commit id as well as a commit message that describes the change.\ncommit log (aka Git History) - all of the commits (previous changes) to all of the files in your repository\n\n https://github.com/dmil/my-simple-website/commits/master\n\n\nHistory, Raw, and Blame for any file\n\n\nRaw - actual contents of the file without any formatting applied.\n\nexample: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/chartbuilder-2/blob/master/src/styles/core.scss\n\nHistory - every change ever made to that file within this branch.\n\nexample: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/chartbuilder-2/commits/master/src/styles/core.scss\n\nBlame - provenance of each line currently in the file you’re looking at in the branch you’re looking at\n\nexample: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/chartbuilder-2/blame/master/src/styles/core.scss\n\n\n\n\nBranches\n\n\nPull Requests\n\n\nProposing Edits\n\nYou can edit a file in GitHub in a new branch, thus proposing a change without actually making the change in the master branch. Just make sure to leave a meaningful description of the change you made in the commit message.\n\n\n\nDrag and Drop\n\n\n\nCollaboration\nCollaborators can push to the repository without asking your permission, they have full read and write access.\n\nIf I wasn’t a collaborator, I could still work with you on an open source project through a process called forking where I can make a copy of your repository in my GitHub account, make changes, and request that you merge them back into your project. We will discuss forking more in depth later.\n\n\nServing up Websites!\nGitHub is also great for serving up static websites. GitHub is only storing the code. Luckily, if your code happens to be a website, GitHub can also host it for you through a feature called “GitHub Pages”.\nSimply go to the “settings” menu, scroll down to “GitHub Pages”, and select “master branch”\n\nWhatever is in your master branch on GitHub should now appear at\nhttp://your-username.github.io/repository-name\nin my case it is http://madisoncoots.github.io/"

When we sum up all connections of a node, not all neighbors are equally important. This is a very interesting way to measure popularity in our classroom where we say the popularity of your friends matters more than the number of friends. Let’s consider two nodes in a friend network with same degree, the one who is connected to more central nodes should be more central.\nFirst, we define an initial guess for the centrality of nodes in a graph as \\(x_i=1\\). Now we are going to iterate for the new centrality value \\(x_i'\\) for node \\(i\\) as following:\n\\[x_i' = \\sum_{j} A_{ij}x_j\\]\nHere \\(A_{ij}\\) is an element of the adjacency matrix, where it gives 1 or 0 for whether an edge exists between nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). it can also be written in matrix notation as \\(\\mathbf{x'} = \\mathbf{Ax}\\).\nWe iterate over t steps to find the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\) as:\n\\[\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{A^t x}(0)\\]\n\npar(bg=\"grey98\")\nplot(network, layout=lay, \n     vertex.label.dist=1.5, vertex.label.color = \"black\", edge.color=\"grey80\",\n     vertex.size=evcent(network)$vector*15,   # Rescaled by multiplying by 15\n     main=\"Eigenvector Centrality\", vertex.color=\"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows, the students which have the same number of friend nominations are not necessarily in the same size. The one that is connected to more central, or “popular” nodes are larger in this visualization.\nHowever, as we can see from the definition, this can be a problematic measure for directed graphs. Let’s say that a student who received no friend nominations themselves nominates another student as a friend. Because that person has 0 friend nominations themselves, they would not contribute any importance to the person they nominated. In other words, eigenvector centrality would not take zero in-degree nodes into account in directed graphs.\nHowever there is a solution to this!"

In order to find out such nodes, the HITS algorithm introduces two types of central nodes: Hubs and Authorities. For Hubs, we might consider a node important if it links to many highly nominated nodes (i.e. the person nominates many popular people as their friends). For Authorities, we might consider a node to be of importance if many highly nominated nodes link to it (i.e. nominated by many popular people).\nAuthority Centrality is defined as the sum of the hub centralities which point to the node (i):\n\\[x_i = \\alpha \\sum_{j} A_{ij} y_j,\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is constant. Likewise, Hub Centrality is the sum of the authorities which are pointed by the node \\(i\\):\n\\[y_i = \\beta \\sum_{j} A_{ji} x_j,\\]\nwith constant \\(\\beta\\). Here notice that the element of the adjacency matrix are swapped for Hub Centrality because we are concerned with outgoing edges for hubs. So in matrix notation:\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = \\alpha \\mathbf{Ay}, \\quad\\]\n\\[\\mathbf{y} = \\beta \\mathbf{A^Tx}.\\] As it can be seen from the drawing, HITS Algorithm also tackles the problem with zero in-degree nodes of Eigenvector Centrality. These zero in-degree nodes become central hubs and contribute to other nodes. Yet we can still use a free centrality contribution constant like in Katz Centrality or other variants.\nAlthough these measures are generally used in a citation network or the internet, this can be pretty interesting in the context of our classroom frienship network. Maybe we are interested in knowing who are the non-popular students that nominate many popular students as friends, but receive no reciprocity in terms of nominations."

If this sounds confusing, you’re not alone."

The reason being, odds ratios tend to exaggerate relative risks for common outcomes.\nLet’s say we find an odds ratio of 2 for a drug reducing heart attack risk. Many might (mistakenly) interpret this as “patients on the drug are twice as likely to avoid heart attacks.” In reality, they have twice the odds, which doesn’t translate directly to actual probabilities, especially when the event is common."

A common misinterpretation might be: “Patients on the drug have twice the likelihood to avoid heart attacks.” This is a misconception. They have twice the odds, not twice the probability. This distinction becomes especially murky when the event (heart attack) is common.\n\n\nMarginal Effects and Interpretation\nThe marginal effect of the drug can be found by computing the difference in predicted probabilities between drug users and non-users, holding other variables constant. This gives a more direct measure of the drug’s impact on the probability of heart attack.\nUsing our model, you can compute the marginal effect for any given age. For example, for someone aged 55:\n\npredicted_prob_on_drug &lt;- predict(model_high_risk, \n                                  newdata = data.frame(age = 55, drug_use = 1),\n                                  type = \"response\")\n\npredicted_prob_off_drug &lt;- predict(model_high_risk, \n                                   newdata = data.frame(age = 55, drug_use = 0),\n                                   type = \"response\")\n\nmarginal_effect_55 &lt;- predicted_prob_on_drug - predicted_prob_off_drug\n\nmarginal_effect_55\n\n         1 \n-0.1622666 \n\n\nThe result is a clear percentage point decrease in the probability of a heart attack for drug users compared to non-users.\nThis means that, for individuals aged 55, using the drug results in a 16 percentage point decrease in the probability of experiencing a heart attack compared to those not using the drug. This direct interpretation offers a tangible sense of the drug’s impact and is far more intuitive than grappling with odds ratios."

    "section": "Average Marginal Effects: A Comprehensive View",
    "text": "Average Marginal Effects: A Comprehensive View\nBeyond just evaluating the marginal effect at specific values, we can compute the average marginal effect (AME) across our sample. AMEs provide a holistic view of the predictor’s impact by averaging its effects over all observations in our dataset. It’s particularly insightful when dealing with continuous predictors like age.\n\nComputing the Average Marginal Effects\nTo compute the AMEs in R, you can leverage the margins package:\n\n#install.packages(\"margins\")\nlibrary(margins)\n\name &lt;- margins(model_high_risk, variables = \"drug_use\")\nsummary(ame)\n\n   factor     AME     SE       z      p   lower   upper\n drug_use -0.1556 0.0291 -5.3429 0.0000 -0.2127 -0.0985\n\n\nThis will give you the average marginal effect of drug use on the probability of a heart attack across all ages in the dataset.\n\n\nInterpreting the AMEs\nSuppose the AME for drug use is -0.156. This means that, on average, across all ages in our sample, using the drug is associated with a 15.6 percentage point decrease in the probability of experiencing a heart attack relative to not using the drug.\nThis single number provides an overarching sense of the drug’s impact, making it immensely useful for policy and clinical decisions. For instance, in public health discussions or in communications with patients, being able to state the average effect of a treatment can be more practical than specifying its impact at particular ages or conditions.\nBy incorporating AMEs into your analysis, you’re providing an extra layer of depth to your findings. This approach shifts the discussion from “what might the effect be?” to “here’s the effect, on average, across our population.” When combined with specific marginal effects and predicted probabilities, this trio offers a robust, comprehensive, and intuitive understanding of your predictors’ impacts."

    "section": "LASSO and Ridge Regression",
    "text": "LASSO and Ridge Regression\n\nConcept\nLeast Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Ridge Regression both fall under a broader class of models called shrinkage models. Shrinkage models regularize or penalize coefficient estimates, which means that they shrink the coefficients toward zero. Shrinking the coefficient estimates can reduce their variance, so these methods are particularly useful for models where we are concerned about high variance (i.e. over-fitting), such as models with a large number of predictors relative to the number of observations.\nBoth LASSO and Ridge regression operate by adding a penalty to the normal OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) minimization problem. These penalties can be thought of as a budget, and sometimes the minimization problem is explicitly formulated as minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) subject to a budget constraint. The idea of the budget is if you have a small budget, you can only afford a little “total” \\(\\beta\\), where the definition of “total” \\(\\beta\\) varies between LASSO and Ridge, but as your budget increases, you get closer and closer to the OLS \\(\\beta\\)s.\nLASSO and Ridge regression differ in exactly how they penalize the coefficients. In particular, LASSO penalizes the coefficients using an \\(L_1\\) penalty:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\n    y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j x_{ij}\n    \\right)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j| = RSS + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\n\\]\nRidge regression penalizes the coefficients using an \\(L_2\\) penalty:\n\\[\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\n    y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j x_{ij}\n    \\right)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2 = RSS + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2\n\\] You may notice that both the LASSO and Ridge Regression minimization problems feature a parameter \\(\\lambda\\). This is a tuning parameter that dictates how much we will penalize the “total” coefficients. Tuning parameters appear in many models and get their name from the fact that we tune (adjust / choose) them in order to improve our model’s performance.\nSince LASSO and Ridge Regression are used when we are concerned about variance (over-fitting), it should come as no surprise that increasing \\(\\lambda\\) decreases variance. It can be helpful to contextualize the \\(\\lambda\\) size by realizing that \\(\\lambda=0\\) is OLS and \\(\\lambda =\\infty\\) results in only \\(\\beta_0\\) being assigned a non-zero value.\nAs we increase \\(\\lambda\\) from zero, we decrease variance but increase bias (the classic bias-variance tradeoff). To determine the best \\(\\lambda\\) (e.g. the \\(\\lambda\\) that will lead to the best out of sample predictive performance), it is common to use cross validation. A good function in R that trains LASSO and Ridge Regression models and uses cross-validation to select a good \\(\\lambda\\) is cv.glmnet(), which is part of the glmnet package.\n\n\nKey difference between LASSO and Ridge\nAs noted above, both LASSO and Ridge regression shrink the coefficients toward zero. However, the penalty in Ridge (\\(\\lambda \\beta_j^2\\)) will not set any of coefficients exactly to zero (unless \\(\\lambda =\\infty\\)). Increasing the value of \\(\\lambda\\) will tend to reduce the magnitudes of the coefficients (which helps reduce variance), but will not result in exclusion of any of the variables. While this may not impact prediction accuracy, it can create a challenge in model interpretation in settings where the number of features is large. This is an obvious disadvantage.\nOn the other hand, the \\(L_1\\) penalty of LASSO forces some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly equal to zero when the tuning parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is sufficiently large. Therefore, LASSO performs variable selection, much like best subset selection.\n\n\nImplementation and Considerations\nLASSO and Ridge Regression are useful models to use when dealing with a large number of predictors \\(p\\) relative to the number of observations \\(n\\). It is good to standardize your features so that coefficients are not selected because of their scale rather than their relative importance.\nFor example, suppose you were predicting salary, and suppose you had a standardized test score that was highly predictive of salary and you also had parents’ income, which was only somewhat predictive of salary. Since standardized test scores are measured on a much smaller scale than the outcome and than parents’ income, we would expect the coefficient on test scores to be large relative to the coefficient on parents’ income. This means it would likely be shrunk by adding the penalty, even though it reflects a strong predictive relationship.\n\n\nInterpreting Coefficients\nCoefficients produced by LASSO and Ridge Regression should not be interpreted causally. These methods are used for prediction, and as such, our focus is on \\(\\hat{y}\\). This is in contrast to an inference problem, where we would be interested in \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\).\nThe intuition behind why we cannot interpret the coefficients causally is similar to the intuition underlying Omitted Variables Bias (OVB). In OVB, we said that if two variables \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) were correlated with each other and with the outcome \\(Y\\), then the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) in a regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(X_1\\) would differ from the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) in a regression where \\(X_2\\) was also included. This is because since \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are correlated, when we omit \\(X_2\\), the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) picks up the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(Y\\) as well as some of the effect of \\(X_2\\) on \\(Y\\)."

    "section": "Principal Components Analysis and Regression",
    "text": "Principal Components Analysis and Regression\n\nPrincipal Components Analysis\nPrincipal Components Analysis is a method of unsupervised learning. We have not yet covered unsupervised learning, though we will in the second half of the semester. The important thing to know at this point about unsupervised learning is that unsupervised learning methods do not use labels \\(Y\\).\nPrincipal Components Analysis (PCA), therefore, does not use \\(Y\\) in determining the principal components. Instead, the principal components are determined solely by looking at the predictors \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\). Each principal component is a weighted sum of the original predictors \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\). For clarity of notation, we will use \\(Z\\) to represent principal components and \\(X\\) to represent predictors.\nPrincipal components are created in an ordered way. The order can be described as follows: If you had to project all of the data onto only one line, the first principal component defines the line that would lead to points being as spread out as possible (e.g. having highest variance). If you had to project all of the data onto only one plane, the plane defined by the first two principal components (which are orthogonal by definition) would be the plane where the points were as spread out as possible (e.g. highest possible variance).\nSince variance is greatly affected by measurement scale, it is common practice and a good idea to scale your variables, so that results are not driven by the scale on which the variables were measured.\nWhen estimating principal components, you will estimate \\(p\\) components, where \\(p\\) is the number of predictors \\(X\\). However, you usually only pay attention to / use the first few components, since the last few components capture very little variance. Note that you can exactly recover your original data when using all \\(p\\) components.\n\n\nPrincipal Components Regression\nPrincipal Components Regression (PCR) regresses the outcome \\(Y\\) on the principal components \\(Z_1\\),…,\\(Z_M\\), where \\(M&lt;p\\) and \\(p\\) is the number of predictors \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\).\nNote that the principal components \\(Z_1\\),…,\\(Z_M\\) were defined by looking only at \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\) and not at \\(Y\\). Putting the principal components into a regression is the first time we are introducing any interaction between the principal components and the outcome \\(Y\\).\nThe main idea of Principal Components Regression is that hopefully only a few components explain most of the variance in the predictors overall and as is relevant to the relationship between the predictors and the response. In other words, when we use PCR, we assume that the directions in which \\(X\\) shows the most variance are also the directions most associated with \\(Y\\). When this assumption is true, we are able to use \\(M&lt;&lt;p\\) (e.g. \\(M\\) much smaller than \\(p\\)) parameters while still getting similar in-sample performance and hopefully better out-of-sample performance (due to not overfitting) to a regression of \\(Y\\) on all \\(p\\) predictors. Although the assumption is not guaranteed to be true, it is often a good enough approximation to give good results.\nPCA is one example of dimensionality reduction, because it reduces the dimension of the problem from \\(p\\) to \\(M\\). Note, though, that dimensionality reduction is different from feature selection. We are still using all features; we have just aggregated them into principal components.\nThe exact number \\(M\\) of principal components to use in PCR (the regression of \\(Y\\) on the principal components) is usually determined by cross-validation.\n\n\nImplementation and Considerations\nWhen using PCR, there are a few things to pay attention to. First, be sure to standardize variables or else the first few principal components will favor features measured on larger scales. Second, the number of principal components to use in PCR is determined using cross-validation. If the number is high and close to the number of features in your data, the assumption that the directions in which the predictors vary most are also the directions that explain the relationship between the predictors and response is false. In such a case, other methods, such as ridge and lasso, are likely to perform better."

    "text": "Partial Least Squares\nPartial Least Squares is a supervised alternative to PCR. Recall that for PCR, the principal components \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\) were formed from the original features \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) without looking at \\(Y\\) (unsupervised).\nPartial Least Squares (PLS) also generates a new set of features \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\) but it uses the correlation between the predictors \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) and the outcome \\(Y\\) to determine the weights on \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) for each \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\). In this way, PLS attempts to find directions that explain both the response and the predictors.\nThe first feature \\(Z_1\\) is determined by weighting \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) proportional to each feature’s correlation with \\(Y\\). It then residualizes the predictors \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) by regressing them on \\(Z_1\\) and repeats the weighting procedure using the orthogonalized predictors. The process then repeats until we have \\(M\\) components, where \\(M\\) is determined by cross validation.\n\nImplementation and Considerations\nJust as with PCR, it’s best practice to scale the predictors before running PLS.\n\n\nComparison with PCR\nPLS directly uses \\(Y\\) in generating the features \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\). It then regresses \\(Y\\) on these features. Therefore, PLS uses \\(Y\\) twice in the process of estimating the model.\nIn contrast, PCR only looks at the outcome \\(Y\\) when estimating the final regression. The components are estimated without ``peeking’’ at \\(Y\\).\nBecause \\(Y\\) is used twice in PLS and only once in PCR, in practice PLS exhibits lower bias (e.g. is better able to fit the training data) but higher variance (e.g. is more sensitive to the exact training data). Therefore, the two methods generally have similar out-of-sample predictive power in practice."

    "text": "Implementation and Considerations\nWhen implementing logistic regression, the restrictions on the features are the same as for linear regression (e.g. no collinearity, number of features must be less than number of observations, etc.). The outcome should be a binary class membership. You can extend the logistic regression to cover a scenario with more than two classes, and this is called multinomial logistic regression, but we will not cover that in class.\nWhen you run logistic regression, the prediction output is a continuous value that reflects the predicted probability that the observation belongs to class 1. Therefore, a decision rule is required to convert the predicted probability to a predicted class (0 or 1). If you care equally about wrongly predicting positive for a True Negative (e.g. predicting class 1 for someone who is actually in class 0) and predicting negative for a True Positive, then a good decision rule is if \\(p(X)\\geq 0.5\\), predict 1 and otherwise predict 0. However, sometimes you care more about an error in one direction than the other. An example of this would be not wanting to offer a loan to someone who will default even if that means you deny more people who wouldn’t default. In that case, you might lower the threshold to 0.2 or some other value. We explore this more in the code."

The methods and their properties are summarized in the table below.\nWhen thinking about if a model is parametric or non-parametric, it can be helpful to think: Do I have a set of parameters that I can use to find the predicted value of any new observation? If yes, it’s parametric. When thinking about if a problem is a classification problem or a regression problem, it is helpful to think about the outcome in the training data. If the outcome is continuous, then it’s a regression problem. If the outcome is categorical, it’s a classification problem. The emphasis on the outcome in the training data is to avoid the confusion that arises when you look at prediction output. As we saw with logistic regression, even though it’s a classification problem, the output will be a probability (which is continuous and needs to be converted to 0 or 1 in order to measure performance)."

You then need to convert the probability to a class membership using a decision rule. A good general rule is: ``whichever class is assigned the highest probability is the predicted class.’’ However, when you have reason to prefer an error in one direction (e.g. predicting more people will default than actually will), you should change this threshold. Exactly which threshold is optimal will depend on domain knowledge and other factors (such as how costly defaults are or how profitable repaid loans are)."

    "text": "Concept\nRecall that the Bayes’ Classifier is the unattainable gold standard classifier. It assumes knowledge of the true underlying distribution of the data, which you will not have in practice. Given features \\(X\\), it knows the true probability that \\(Y\\) belongs to each possible class. It predicts the most likely class, which is the best decision rule given the available features.\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) approximates the Bayes’ Classifier, given the information available and the assumption that features are Normally (Gaussian) distributed within each class. The result is decision boundaries that are linear in the included features.\nWhen there is one feature (predictor), LDA estimates class-specific means \\(\\hat{\\mu}_k\\) and a single variance \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) that is common to all classes. When there are multiple features, LDA estimates class-specific mean vectors \\(\\hat{\\mu}_k\\) and a single variance-covariance matrix \\(\\hat{\\Sigma}\\) that is assumed to be relevant to all classes. In both cases (one feature or many features), LDA also calculates the unconditional probability of belonging to each class \\(\\hat{\\pi}_k\\). LDA then takes these components (means, variance, and unconditional class probability) and calculates a discriminant function for each observation and each class. For each observation, the predicted class is determined by the largest discriminant.\nQuadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) is conceptually similar, though instead of requiring all classes to share the same variance or variance-covariance matrix, it allows for class-specific variances. This has the effect of allowing non-linear decision boundaries. The drawback, though, is that allowing for class-specific variances (and especially class-specific variance-covariance matrices) increases the number of parameters to estimate, increasing the likelihood of overfitting."

They are also parametric, which means they are computationally efficient with large data sets compared to non-parametric KNN. However, they both make the assumption that the features are normally distributed, so you should pay attention to your data. For example, binary variables will never be normally distributed nor well approximated by a normal distribution, and so the methods are not appropriate to use in the presence of binary features.\nQDA differs from LDA by assuming the variance or variance-covariance matrix of the feature(s) varies from class to class. This allows for more flexible and non-linear decision boundaries, but requires estimation of more parameters. As with all other models we’ve seen, estimating more parameters increases the likelihood of overfitting and so should only be used when the number of observations is large relative to the number of features and classes."

To do this, we will use set.seed(), which will allow us to draw the same pseudorandom numbers the next time we run this code, and we will use the sample() function.\n\nset.seed(222)\n\nThe sample() function takes two arguments: The first is a vector of numbers from which to draw a random sample. The second is the number of random numbers to draw. The default is to sample without replacement, but you can sample with replacement by adding “, replace = TRUE” inside the function. Now, let’s generate a list of indices from the original dataset that will be designated part of the test set using sample()\n\ntest_ids &lt;- sample(1:(nrow(college_data)), round(0.2 * nrow(college_data)))\n\nTo identify the training_ids, we want all of the numbers from 1:nrow(college_data) that aren’t test IDs. Recall that which() returns the indices for which the statement inside the parentheses is true. which(!()) returns the indices for which the statement inside the parentheses is false. The “!” means “not”. Also, if you wanted to know which values of vector A were in vector B, you can use which(A %in% B). So if you want to know which values of vector A are NOT in vector B, you use which(!(A %in B)), so that’s what we will do – vector A is the vector of all integers between 1 and the number of rows in our data. vector B is the vector of test IDs\n\ntraining_ids &lt;- which(!(1:(nrow(college_data)) %in% test_ids))\n\nWe can use these indices to define our test and training sets by putting those vectors in the row position inside square brackets.\n\ntest_data &lt;- college_data[test_ids,]\ntraining_data &lt;- college_data[training_ids,]"

    "text": "KNN Classification\nLet’s develop a KNN model to try to predict whether it’s a private college using all available features.\nTo use KNN for classification, we need to install and load the library “class”\n\nlibrary(class)\n\nknn() is the function we will use to run the KNN model. It takes four arguments:\n\ntrain = training data features (no outcome)\ntest = test data features (no outcome)\ncl = training data outcome (class each observation belongs to)\nk = number of nearest neighbors to use\n\nFor two-class classification problems, k should be odd (avoids tied votes). Let’s run the model with 1 NN and 9 NNs. To exclude a column, use -# in the column position insider square brackets. (e.g. df[, -2] excludes the second column of dataframe df)\n\nknn_model1 &lt;- knn(train = training_data[, -1],\n                  test = test_data[, -1],\n                  cl = training_data[, 1],\n                  k = 1)\n\nknn_model9 &lt;- knn(train = training_data[, -1],\n                  test = test_data[, -1],\n                  cl = training_data[, 1],\n                  k = 9)\n\nWe are trying to predict Private Yes/No. knn() output predicted values for our test data, so we can compare actual v. predicted values. “prediction == actual” gives a vector with the same number of elements as there are observations in the test set. Each element will either be TRUE (the prediction was correct) or FALSE (the prediction was wrong). Applying which() to this vector will yield the index numbers for all the elements equal to TRUE. Applying length() to that vector tells us how many are TRUE (e.g. for how many observations prediction == actual). We can then divide by the number of observations in the test data to obtain the accuracy rate\n\naccuracy1  &lt;- length(which(knn_model1 == test_data$Private)) / nrow(test_data)\naccuracy9 &lt;- length(which(knn_model9 == test_data$Private)) / nrow(test_data)\n\nprint(accuracy1)\n\n[1] 0.9096774\n\nprint(accuracy9)\n\n[1] 0.9225806\n\n\nLet’s visualize what is happening in a KNN classification model. We will use the ggplot2 package to create a scatterplot of the training data, and then overlay the test data on top of it. We will color the points by whether the school is private or not.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = training_data, \n       aes(x = Outstate, y = F.Undergrad, \n           color = as.factor(Private))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(data = test_data, aes(x = Outstate, y = F.Undergrad), \n             color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"blue\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Private\")) \n\n\n\n\nThis seems like excellent predictive performance. However, it’s good to think about the distribution of the data. As an extreme example, if all schools in the data were private, we would expect 100% prediction accuracy regardless of our model. Let’s see how well we do if our prediction is all schools are Private. Start by calculating the proportion of private schools\n\nprint(length(which(test_data$Private == \"Yes\")) / nrow(test_data))\n\n[1] 0.716129\n\n\nWe can also check our accuracy on Private schools v. Public schools. To do this, we need to figure out which schools are private in the test data. Specifically, get the indices for the private schools\n\nprivate_schools &lt;- which(test_data$Private == \"Yes\")\npublic_schools &lt;- which(test_data$Private == \"No\")\n\nprint(private_schools)\n\n  [1]   1   2   3   8  11  12  13  14  15  16  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  27\n [19]  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  37  38  39  41  42  43  44  45  47  48\n [37]  49  50  51  52  53  55  56  57  58  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  68  69\n [55]  76  77  78  80  81  82  84  85  86  90  91  92  93  94  96  97  99 100\n [73] 101 102 104 106 107 108 110 112 113 116 119 120 121 122 123 125 127 128\n [91] 129 130 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 142 145 146 147 148 149 151 152\n[109] 153 154 155\n\nprint(public_schools)\n\n [1]   4   5   6   7   9  10  17  25  26  36  40  46  54  59  67  70  71  72  73\n[20]  74  75  79  83  87  88  89  95  98 103 105 109 111 114 115 117 118 124 126\n[39] 131 132 141 143 144 150\n\n\nTo calculate the prediction accuracy for private schools, we need to know how many (true not predicted) private schools are in the test data. Likewise, we need to know how many public schools are in the test data.\n\nnum_private_schools &lt;- length(private_schools)\nnum_public_schools &lt;- length(public_schools)\n\nNow we will calculate the prediction accuracy separately for private and public schools.\n\nprivate_accuracy1 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model1[private_schools] == test_data$Private[private_schools])) /\n  num_private_schools\n\nprivate_accuracy9 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model9[private_schools] == test_data$Private[private_schools])) /\n  num_private_schools\n\nNow we will calculate the prediction accuracy separately for private and public schools.\n\n## Private schools (% correctly predicted):\nprivate_accuracy1 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model1[private_schools] == test_data$Private[private_schools])) /\n  num_private_schools\n\nprivate_accuracy9 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model9[private_schools] == test_data$Private[private_schools])) /\n  num_private_schools\n\n\n# Public schools (% correctly predicted): \npublic_accuracy1 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model1[public_schools] == test_data$Private[public_schools])) /\n  num_public_schools\n\npublic_accuracy9 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model9[public_schools] == test_data$Private[public_schools])) /\n  num_public_schools\n\nLet’s see how it did on different school types:\n\nprint(private_accuracy1)\n\n[1] 0.9459459\n\nprint(public_accuracy1)\n\n[1] 0.8181818\n\nprint(private_accuracy9)\n\n[1] 0.972973\n\nprint(public_accuracy9)\n\n[1] 0.7954545\n\n\nTherefore, we did better on private schools than public schools because our prediction accuracy was higher on private schools. Thinking about differential performance by label is related to fairness of machine learning algorithms.

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n\n\n\nThe datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\nDownload the dataset here:\n\ndiabetes_data &lt;- read.csv(\"diabetes.csv\", header = TRUE)\n\nLet’s get to know our data.\n\ndim(diabetes_data)\n\n[1] 768   9\n\nsummary(diabetes_data)\n\n  Pregnancies        Glucose      BloodPressure    SkinThickness  \n Min.   : 0.000   Min.   :  0.0   Min.   :  0.00   Min.   : 0.00  \n 1st Qu.: 1.000   1st Qu.: 99.0   1st Qu.: 62.00   1st Qu.: 0.00  \n Median : 3.000   Median :117.0   Median : 72.00   Median :23.00  \n Mean   : 3.845   Mean   :120.9   Mean   : 69.11   Mean   :20.54  \n 3rd Qu.: 6.000   3rd Qu.:140.2   3rd Qu.: 80.00   3rd Qu.:32.00  \n Max.   :17.000   Max.   :199.0   Max.   :122.00   Max.   :99.00  \n    Insulin           BMI        DiabetesPedigreeFunction      Age       \n Min.   :  0.0   Min.   : 0.00   Min.   :0.0780           Min.   :21.00  \n 1st Qu.:  0.0   1st Qu.:27.30   1st Qu.:0.2437           1st Qu.:24.00  \n Median : 30.5   Median :32.00   Median :0.3725           Median :29.00  \n Mean   : 79.8   Mean   :31.99   Mean   :0.4719           Mean   :33.24  \n 3rd Qu.:127.2   3rd Qu.:36.60   3rd Qu.:0.6262           3rd Qu.:41.00  \n Max.   :846.0   Max.   :67.10   Max.   :2.4200           Max.   :81.00  \n    Outcome     \n Min.   :0.000  \n 1st Qu.:0.000  \n Median :0.000  \n Mean   :0.349  \n 3rd Qu.:1.000  \n Max.   :1.000  \n\n\nFrom the output, we see that we have one binary variable (Outcome) and eight continuous variables. We have 768 observations.\nToday, we will focus on predicting Outcome: (whether or not a patient has diabetes)\nLet’s start with KNN for classification, so load the required package:\n\nlibrary(class)\n\nWe are interested in using KNN on this dataset, but we aren’t sure which k will give the best out-of-sample accuracy. We can use cross-validation to find the best k in this sense.\n\n\n\nAn R function is created by using the keyword function. The basic syntax of an R function definition is as follows −\n\nfunction_name &lt;- function(arg_1, arg_2, ...) {\n   Function body \n}\n\nThe different parts of a function are:\n\nFunction Name: This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in R environment as an object with this name.\nArguments: An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.\nFunction Body: The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does.\nReturn Value: The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.\n\n\n## Example of a simple function\nadd_fun &lt;- function(a1, a2){\n  res = a1 + a2\n  return(res)\n}\n\nadd_fun(3, 4)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s write a function to do cross-validation. We will name the function cross_validation_KNN() and it will take 3 arguments:\n\nThe feature columns of the data\nThe outcome column of the data (Y)\nA vector of all k values to test\nThe number of folds to use in k-fold cross validation\n\n\ncross_validation_KNN  &lt;- function(data_x, data_y, k_seq, kfolds) {\n    \n  ## We will start by assigning each observation to one and \n  ## only one fold for cross-validation. To do this, we use\n  ## an index vector. The vector's length equals the number\n  ## of observations in the data. The vector's entries are \n  ## equal numbers of 1s, 2s, etc. up to the number of folds\n  ## being used for k-fold cross validation.\n  ## Recall seq(5) is a vector (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n  ## ceiling() rounds a number up to the nearest integer\n  ## rep(a, b) repeats a b times (e.g. rep(1, 3) =&gt; (1, 1, 1))\n  ## So this says repeat the sequence from 1:kfolds\n  ## enough times to fill a vector that is as long or \n  ## slightly longer than the number of observations in\n  ## the data. Then, if the length of the vector exceeds\n  ## the number of observations, truncate it to the right\n  ## length\n  \n  fold_ids &lt;- rep(seq(kfolds), ceiling(nrow(data_x) / kfolds))\n  fold_ids &lt;- fold_ids[1:nrow(data_x)]\n  \n  ## To make the IDs random, randomly rearrange the vector\n  fold_ids &lt;- sample(fold_ids, length(fold_ids))\n  \n  ## In order to store the prediction performance for each fold\n  ## for each k, we initialize a matrix.\n  CV_error_mtx  &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = length(k_seq), ncol = kfolds)\n  \n  ## To run CV, we will loop over all values of k that we want to \n  ## consider for KNN. For each value of k, we will loop over all\n  ## folds. For each fold, we will estimate KNN for the given k on \n  ## all but one fold. We will then measure the model's accuracy \n  ## on the hold out fold and save it. After we finish looping \n  ## through all k's and all folds, we will find the average CV\n  ## error for each value of k and use that as a measure of the \n  ## model's performance.\n  for (k in k_seq) {\n    for (fold in 1:kfolds) {\n      ## Train the KNN model (Note: if it throws a weird error, make sure\n      ## all features are numeric variables -- not factors)\n      ## Note: usually the features are normalized/re-scaled\n      ## Otherwise KNN will give more weight to variables at the larger scale\n      ## when calculating the distance metric.\n      ## See page 165 of the textbook for a useful example\n      knn_fold_model &lt;- knn(train = scale(data_x[which(fold_ids != fold),]),\n                            test = scale(data_x[which(fold_ids == fold),]),\n                            cl = data_y[which(fold_ids != fold)],\n                            k = k)\n      \n      ## Measure and save error rate (% wrong)\n      CV_error_mtx[k, fold] &lt;- mean(knn_fold_model != \n                                      data_y[which(fold_ids == fold)])\n    }\n  }\n  \n  ## We want our function to return the accuracy matrix\n  return(CV_error_mtx)\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\nWe can now use the cross-validation function on real data.

To find the mean for each row, we can use the function rowMeans(). Note that an equivalent function exists for taking the means of columns: colMeans(). There are also functions for rowSums() and colSums().\n\nmean_cv_error5 &lt;- rowMeans(knn_cv_error5)\nmean_cv_error10 &lt;- rowMeans(knn_cv_error10)\n\nTo find the position of the smallest CV error, use which.min().\n\nwhich.min(mean_cv_error5)\n\n[1] 18\n\nwhich.min(mean_cv_error10)\n\n[1] 36\n\n\nTo understand how perform changes across the K values, a plot would be helpful.\n\nplot(seq(20), mean_cv_error5, type = \"l\",\n     main = \"Mean CV Error Rate as a Function of k\",\n     ylab = \"CV Error Rate\", xlab = \"k\")\n\n\n\n\nFrom this, we see that low k values have poor performance while large k values seem to have roughly equivalent performance."

    "text": "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n\n\n\nThe datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\nDownload the dataset here:\n\ndiabetes_data &lt;- read.csv(\"diabetes.csv\", header = TRUE)\n\nLet’s get to know our data.\n\ndim(diabetes_data)\n\n[1] 768   9\n\nsummary(diabetes_data)\n\n  Pregnancies        Glucose      BloodPressure    SkinThickness  \n Min.   : 0.000   Min.   :  0.0   Min.   :  0.00   Min.   : 0.00  \n 1st Qu.: 1.000   1st Qu.: 99.0   1st Qu.: 62.00   1st Qu.: 0.00  \n Median : 3.000   Median :117.0   Median : 72.00   Median :23.00  \n Mean   : 3.845   Mean   :120.9   Mean   : 69.11   Mean   :20.54  \n 3rd Qu.: 6.000   3rd Qu.:140.2   3rd Qu.: 80.00   3rd Qu.:32.00  \n Max.   :17.000   Max.   :199.0   Max.   :122.00   Max.   :99.00  \n    Insulin           BMI        DiabetesPedigreeFunction      Age       \n Min.   :  0.0   Min.   : 0.00   Min.   :0.0780           Min.   :21.00  \n 1st Qu.:  0.0   1st Qu.:27.30   1st Qu.:0.2437           1st Qu.:24.00  \n Median : 30.5   Median :32.00   Median :0.3725           Median :29.00  \n Mean   : 79.8   Mean   :31.99   Mean   :0.4719           Mean   :33.24  \n 3rd Qu.:127.2   3rd Qu.:36.60   3rd Qu.:0.6262           3rd Qu.:41.00  \n Max.   :846.0   Max.   :67.10   Max.   :2.4200           Max.   :81.00  \n    Outcome     \n Min.   :0.000  \n 1st Qu.:0.000  \n Median :0.000  \n Mean   :0.349  \n 3rd Qu.:1.000  \n Max.   :1.000  \n\n\nFrom the output, we see that we have one binary variable (Outcome) and eight continuous variables. We have 768 observations.\nToday, we will focus on predicting Outcome: (whether or not a patient has diabetes)\nLet’s start with KNN for classification, so load the required package:\n\nlibrary(class)\n\nWe are interested in using KNN on this dataset, but we aren’t sure which k will give the best out-of-sample accuracy. We can use cross-validation to find the best k in this sense.\n\n\n\nAn R function is created by using the keyword function. The basic syntax of an R function definition is as follows −\n\nfunction_name &lt;- function(arg_1, arg_2, ...) {\n   Function body \n}\n\nThe different parts of a function are:\n\nFunction Name: This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in R environment as an object with this name.\nArguments: An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.\nFunction Body: The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does.\nReturn Value: The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.\n\n\n## Example of a simple function\nadd_fun &lt;- function(a1, a2){\n  res = a1 + a2\n  return(res)\n}\n\nadd_fun(3, 4)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s write a function to do cross-validation. We will name the function cross_validation_KNN() and it will take 3 arguments:\n\nThe feature columns of the data\nThe outcome column of the data (Y)\nA vector of all k values to test\nThe number of folds to use in k-fold cross validation\n\n\ncross_validation_KNN  &lt;- function(data_x, data_y, k_seq, kfolds) {\n    \n  ## We will start by assigning each observation to one and \n  ## only one fold for cross-validation. To do this, we use\n  ## an index vector. The vector's length equals the number\n  ## of observations in the data. The vector's entries are \n  ## equal numbers of 1s, 2s, etc. up to the number of folds\n  ## being used for k-fold cross validation.\n  ## Recall seq(5) is a vector (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n  ## ceiling() rounds a number up to the nearest integer\n  ## rep(a, b) repeats a b times (e.g. rep(1, 3) =&gt; (1, 1, 1))\n  ## So this says repeat the sequence from 1:kfolds\n  ## enough times to fill a vector that is as long or \n  ## slightly longer than the number of observations in\n  ## the data. Then, if the length of the vector exceeds\n  ## the number of observations, truncate it to the right\n  ## length\n  \n  fold_ids &lt;- rep(seq(kfolds), ceiling(nrow(data_x) / kfolds))\n  fold_ids &lt;- fold_ids[1:nrow(data_x)]\n  \n  ## To make the IDs random, randomly rearrange the vector\n  fold_ids &lt;- sample(fold_ids, length(fold_ids))\n  \n  ## In order to store the prediction performance for each fold\n  ## for each k, we initialize a matrix.\n  CV_error_mtx  &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = length(k_seq), ncol = kfolds)\n  \n  ## To run CV, we will loop over all values of k that we want to \n  ## consider for KNN. For each value of k, we will loop over all\n  ## folds. For each fold, we will estimate KNN for the given k on \n  ## all but one fold. We will then measure the model's accuracy \n  ## on the hold out fold and save it. After we finish looping \n  ## through all k's and all folds, we will find the average CV\n  ## error for each value of k and use that as a measure of the \n  ## model's performance.\n  for (k in k_seq) {\n    for (fold in 1:kfolds) {\n      ## Train the KNN model (Note: if it throws a weird error, make sure\n      ## all features are numeric variables -- not factors)\n      ## Note: usually the features are normalized/re-scaled\n      ## Otherwise KNN will give more weight to variables at the larger scale\n      ## when calculating the distance metric.\n      ## See page 165 of the textbook for a useful example\n      knn_fold_model &lt;- knn(train = scale(data_x[which(fold_ids != fold),]),\n                            test = scale(data_x[which(fold_ids == fold),]),\n                            cl = data_y[which(fold_ids != fold)],\n                            k = k)\n      \n      ## Measure and save error rate (% wrong)\n      CV_error_mtx[k, fold] &lt;- mean(knn_fold_model != \n                                      data_y[which(fold_ids == fold)])\n    }\n  }\n  \n  ## We want our function to return the accuracy matrix\n  return(CV_error_mtx)\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\nWe can now use the cross-validation function on real data. Note that the outcome is stored in the 9th column.\n\nset.seed(222)\nknn_cv_error5 &lt;- cross_validation_KNN(data_x = diabetes_data[, -9],\n                                      data_y =

    "text": "Lab 9\n\nGeneral Guidelines:\nYou will encounter a few functions we did not cover in the lecture video. This will give you some practice on how to use a new function for the first time. You can try following steps:\n\nStart by typing ?new_function in your Console to open up the help page\nRead the help page of this new_function. The description might be too technical for now. That’s OK. Pay attention to the Usage and Arguments, especially the argument x or x,y (when two arguments are required)\nAt the bottom of the help page, there are a few examples. Run the first few lines to see how it works\nApply it in your lab questions\n\nIt is highly likely that you will encounter error messages while doing this lab Here are a few steps that might help get you through it.\n\nLocate which line is causing this error first\nCheck if you may have a typo in the code. Sometimes another person can spot a typo faster than you.\nIf you enter the code without any typo, try googling the error message\nScroll through the top few links see if any of them helps\nTry working on the next few questions while waiting for answers by TAs\n\n\n\nQuestions\nRecall a function has the following form\n\nname &lt;- function(args) { \n  # body\n  do something (probably with args) \n  }\n\n\nWrite a function called calc_quadratic that takes an input x and calculates \\(f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1\\). For example:\n\n\ncalc_quadratic(5)\n\n[1] 36\n\n\n\nWhat are the arguments to your function? What is the body of the function?\nThis function is vectorized! (Since binary operators are vectorized). Show this is true by running calc_quadratic with an input vector that is -10 to 10.\n\n\nYou realize you want to be able to work with any quadratic. Update your functions so that it can work with any quadratic in standard form \\(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\n\nYour new function will take arguments x, a, b and c.\nSet the default arguments to a=1, b=2 and c=1.\n\n\nWrite a function called solve_quadratic that takes arguments a, b and c and provides the two roots using the quadratic formula.\n\nIn our outline, we suggest you:\n\nCalculate the determinant \\(\\sqrt{b^2 − 4ac}\\) and store as an intermediate value.\nReturn two values by putting them in a vector. If you stored the roots as root_1 and root_2, then the final line of code in the function should be c(root_1, root_2) or, if you prefer, return(c(root_1, root_2)).\n\n\n# fill in the ... with appropriate code\nsolve_quadratic &lt;- function(...){\n  determinant &lt;- ...\n  root_1 &lt;- ...\n  root_2 &lt;- ...\n  c(root_1, root_2)\n}\n\nThe code should work as follows:\n\nsolve_quadratic(a = -4, b = 0, c = 1)\n\n[1] -0.5  0.5\n\n\n\nWe “normalize” a variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation \\(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\) .\n\nWrite a function called normalize that takes a vector as input and normalizes it. You should get the following output.\n\nnormalize(1:5)\n\n[1] -1.2649111 -0.6324555  0.0000000  0.6324555  1.2649111\n\n\n\nWhat output do you get when the input vector is 0:4? How about -100:-96? Why?\nWhat happens when your input vector is c(1,2,3,4,5, NA)? Rewrite the function so the result is:\nThe txhousing data set comes with ggplot. Use your normalize function in mutate to create normalized_annual_volume to make the following graph.\n\n\n# replace the ... with the appropriate code.\ntxhousing %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, city) %&gt;%\n  summarize(annual_volume = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(...) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = normalized_annual_volume)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(aes(color = city))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulating Data with Monte Carlo Simulations (Extension)\nYou will be asked to investigate statistical concepts using Monte Carlo simulations. We’ll try not to get too technical in the main body of the lab. There are some “technical notes” which you can ignore!\nIn a monte carlo simulation, you repeatedly:\n\nGenerate random samples of data using a known process.\nMake calculations based on the random sample.\nAggregate the results.\n\nFunctions and loops help us do these repetitious acts efficiently, without repeatedly writing similar code or copying and pasting.\nToday’s problem: Let us investigate how good the random number generator in R is.1 We hypothesize that rnorm(n, mean = true_mean) provides random sample of size n from the normal distribution with mean = true_mean and standard deviation = 1.\nThe lesson is organized as follows.\n\nWe do a single simulation.\nWe take the logic of the simulation, encapsulate it in functions and then run 1000s of simulations!\n\n\nA single simulation\nRecall our hypothesis is that rnorm() faithfully gives us random numbers from the normal distribution. If we test this with a single random draw, we might be misled. For example, let’s draw 30 numbers from a normal distribution with true mean of 0.5 and see if the observed mean appears statistically different from the true mean.\n\n# Setting a seed ensures replicability\nset.seed(4)\n# we set our parameters\ntrue_mean &lt;- .5\nN &lt;- 30\n# We simulate and observe outcomes\nsimulated_data &lt;- rnorm(N, mean = true_mean) # the standard deviation is 1 by default!\nobs_mean &lt;- mean(simulated_data)\nobs_mean\n\n[1] 0.9871873\n\n\nWow! The observed mean is twice what we expected given true_mean! Let’s calculate a z-score to put that in perspective. (Focus on the formulas, you’ll learn the intuition in stats class)\nA z-score is calculated \\(\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{\\frac{s_n}{\\sqrt{N}}}\\) where \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean, \\(\\mu\\) is the true mean, \\(s_n\\) is the sample standard deviation and \\(N\\) is the number of observations.\n\nobs_sd &lt;- sd(simulated_data)\nzscore &lt;- (obs_mean - true_mean) / (obs_sd / sqrt(N)) \nzscore\n\n[1] 3.303849\n\n\nWe expect the observed mean of this simulated data will be within 1.96 standard deviations of \\(\\mu\\) 95 out of 100 times.This observation is 3.3 standard deviations from Mu. The probability of that happening by chance is very small. To be more formal about this probability, we can calculate a p-value. Plug in the z-score below:\n\n(1 - pnorm(abs(zscore)))*2\n\n[1] 0.000953672\n\n\nThis says that the probability of getting this draw by chance is less than 0.1 percent or 1 in 1000.\nThat outcome seems surprising, but we could also just have made an unusual draw. In this workshop, we want to see how often we get such extreme results. We will repeat the steps above 1000 times each, but first we’ll write functions that will make this process smooth!\n\n\nWriting Helper Functions to Make Our Monte Carlo Simulation\nWe want to develop functions that automate repeated steps in our Monte Carlo. In that way, we can define a few important parameters and run the entire process without rewriting or copying and pasting code over and over again.\nAs you saw in the motivating example, we must do the following a 1000 times or B times if parameterize the number of iterations with B:\n\nSimulate data and calculate sample statistics.\nDetermine z-scores.\nTest whether the z-score is outside the threshold. Finally, we:\nMeasure to what extent our simulations match the theory.\n\nTo proceed, we’ll write the steps into their own functions, then call them in the right order in the function do_monte_carlo(). We are breaking a complicated process into smaller chunks and tackling them one by one!\nLet’s look at do_monte_carlo(). It takes a sample-size N, a true_mean, number of iterations B (1000 by default) and a significance level alpha (.05 by default). It returns the proportion of observed means that are significantly different from the true_mean with 95 percent confidence level\n\nBefore following our road map, think about how you would set up functions to automate this process. What would the inputs and outputs be of each step/function? Your processes will be different from ours, but that doesn’t mean ours is better.\n\nNow check out do_monte_carlo() below. It’s our road map.\n\ndo_monte_carlo &lt;- function(N, true_mean, B= 1000, alpha = .05){\n# step 1: Simulate B random samples and calculate sample statistics\n  sample_statistics &lt;- make_mc_sample(N, true_mean, B)\n# step 2: Determine z-scores\n  z_scores &lt;- get_zscores(sample_statistics$mean, true_mean, sample_statistics$sd, N)\n# step 3: Test whether the z-scores are outside the threshold.\n  significance &lt;- test_significance(z_scores, alpha)\n# step 4: Measure to what extent our simulations match the theory. (We expect a number close to alpha)\n  mean(significance)\n}\n\n\n\nDetermine z-scores\nWe’ll start with step 2 determine z-scores. Recall the formula for a zscore is\\(\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{\\frac{s_n}{\\sqrt{N}}}\\).\nWrite a function called get_zscores that takes the observed means and sds, the true mean and N as inputs and returns a z-score as an output. Name the arguments obs_mean, true_mean, obs_sd, and N.\nIf your functions works, it should return 4 for test.\n\ntest &lt;- get_zscores(obs_mean = 4.4, true_mean = 4.3, obs_sd = 0.25, N = 100)\ntest\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThe function you wrote should also work on vectorized functions. Run the following code which takes estimates of the mean and standard deviation from 5 random draws and returns their associated z-scores:\n\n# before running set eval = TRUE (and delete this comment)\nmade_up_means &lt;- c(4.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.2)\nmade_up_sd &lt;- c(.25, .5, .4, 1, .4)\nmade_up_zscores &lt;- get_zscores(obs_mean = made_up_means,\n                               true_mean = 4.3,\n                               obs_sd = made_up_sd,\n                               N = 100)\nmade_up_zscores\n\n\nWhich observation from made_up_zscores is not statistically different from 4.3 with 95 percent confidence? In other words, which observed mean and standard deviation return \\(|z-score| &lt; 1.96\\)?\n\n\n\n\nCheck for Significance\nNow we write code for step 3. Test whether the z-scores are outside the threshold.\nThe threshold depends on alpha and the formula is abs(qnorm(alpha/2)).\n\nFor example, for a two-tailed z-test at the 95% confidence level, the cutoff is set at 1.96. Verify this using the formula above.\nWrite a function test_significance() that takes zscores and a given alpha and determines if there is a significant difference at the given level.\n\nRun the following code, and check that your code matches the expected output:\n\n# before knitting set eval = TRUE (and delete this comment)\ntest_significance(zscores = 2, alpha = 0.05)\n\nShould return TRUE. And:\n\n# before knitting set eval = TRUE (and delete this comment)\ntest_significance(zscores = c(1.9, -0.3, -3), alpha = 0.05)\n\nShould return FALSE, FALSE, and TRUE.\n\nBuilding make_mc_sample()\nNow we do step 1: simulate B random samples and calculate sample statistics.\nOur goal is make_mc_sample(N, true_mean, B) a function that produces sample statistics from B random samples from the normal distribution with mean true_mean of size N. When you think of doing something B times it suggest we need a loop. Let’s start with the body of the loop. And because we’re in a lesson about functions, let’s write a function.\n\nWrite a function called calc_mean_and_sd_from_sample() that\n\n\nGenerates a random sample with rnorm() of size N centered around true_mean\nCalculate the mean() and sd() of the random sample.\nReturn the mean and sd in a tibble with column names mean and sd.\n\nIdea: To return two values from a function, we need to put those values into a data structure like a vector or tibble.\nHere’s a test! Verify your function works. Remember, what guarantees that you get the same numbers from a random number generator as we did is that we’re setting a seed to 5\n\n# before knitting set eval = TRUE (and delete this comment)\nset.seed(5)\ncalc_mean_and_sd_from_sample(N = 30, true_mean = 0.5)\n\nNow, this function only does what we need once, while we’ll need it to do it B times. This is an appropriate time for a loop!\n\nWrite the function make_mc_sample. The inputs are described above. The output is a tibble with B rows of means and standard deviations.\n\nHere’s a test.\n\nset.seed(24601)\nmake_mc_sample(N = 30, true_mean = 100, B = 3 )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n   mean    sd\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  99.8 0.920\n2  99.8 0.952\n3 100.  1.04 \n\n\n\n\nFunctions, Assemble\nNow you have all the helper functions that are critical for our simulation. We want to simulate 1000 sets of 30 data points drawn from a normal distribution with true mean 0.5 and then see how often our random sample mean is significantly different from the true mean at a significance level of 0.05. If everything is working as expected, we should see about 5% of the random means to be statistically different.\n\ndo_monte_carlo &lt;- function(N, true_mean, B = 1000, alpha = .05){\n# step 1: Simulate B random samples and calculate sample statistics\nsample_statistics &lt;- make_mc_sample(N, true_mean, B)\n# step 2: Determine z-scores\nz_scores &lt;- get_zscores(sample_statistics$mean, true_mean, sample_statistics$sd, N)\n# step 3: Test whether the z-scores are outside the threshold.\nsignificance &lt;- test_significance(z_scores, alpha)\n# step 5: Measure to what extent our simulations match the theory. (We expect a number close to alpha)\nmean(significance)\n}\n\n\nTest out your function with N equals 30 and true_mean equals 0.5. The resulting number should be close to .05 (alpha).\nTry again with a different alpha and verify that do_monte_carlo returns a number in the ball park of alpha.\n\nWant to improve this tutorial?

    "text": "Lab 3\n\nGeneral Guidelines:\nYou will encounter a few functions we did not cover in the lecture video. This will give you some practice on how to use a new function for the first time. You can try following steps:\n\nStart by typing ?new_function in your Console to open up the help page\nRead the help page of this new_function. The description might be too technical for now. That’s OK. Pay attention to the Usage and Arguments, especially the argument x or x,y (when two arguments are required)\nAt the bottom of the help page, there are a few examples. Run the first few lines to see how it works\nApply it in your lab questions\n\nIt is highly likely that you will encounter error messages while doing this lab Here are a few steps that might help get you through it.\n\nLocate which line is causing this error first\nCheck if you may have a typo in the code. Sometimes another person can spot a typo faster than you.\nIf you enter the code without any typo, try googling the error message\nScroll through the top few links see if any of them helps\nTry working on the next few questions while waiting for answers by TAs\n\n\n\nWarm-up\n\nIn the lecture, we covered c(), :, rep(), seq() among other ways to create vectors.\n\n\ndolly = c(9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) \nbees = c(\"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\")\n\n\nRecreate dolly using :.\nCreate the same vector using seq().\nRecreate bees using rep().\n\n\nWe are now going to use the functions rnorm() and runif() to initialize vectors.\n\n\nrandom_norm = rnorm(100) \nrandom_unif = runif(1000)\n\n\nHow long are the vectors random_norm and random_unif? Use length() to verify.\nWhat are the largest and smallest values in random_norm and random_unif? Use min() and max().\nUse mean() and sd() to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the two distributions.\nCreate a new vector with 10000 draws from the standard normal distribution.\nrnorm() by default sets mean = 0 (see ?rnorm). Create a vector of 10000 draws from the normal distribution with mean = 1. Use mean() to verify.\n\nNotice the functions min(), max(), mean() and sd() all take a vector with many values and summarize them as one value. These are good to use with summarize() when doing data analysis on simple dataframes.\n\nData Types\n\nUse typeof() to verify the data types of dolly, bees, random_unif\nCoerce dolly to a character vector. Recall we have functions as.&lt;type&gt;() for this kind of coercion.\nTry to coerce bees to type numeric. What does R do when you ask it to turn “b” into a number?\n\n\n\nVectorized Math\n\na and b are vectors of length 10. Look at them in the console.\n\n\na &lt;- 1:10\nb &lt;- rep(c(2, 4), 5)\n\n\nAdd a and b element by element.\nSubtract a and b element by element.\nDivide a by b element by element.\nMultiply a and b element by element.\nRaise the element of a to the power of b element by element.\nMultiply each element of a by 3 then subtract b\nRaise each element of b to the third power.\nTake the square root of each element of a.\n\n\n\nCalculating Mean and Standard Deviation\n\nCalculating the Mean\nIn this exercise, we will calculate the mean of a vector of random numbers. Wewill practice assigning new variables and using functions in R.\nWe can run the following code to create a vector of 1000 random numbers. The function set.seed() ensures that the process used to generate random numbers is the same across computers.\nNote: rf() is a R command we use to generate 1000 random numbers according to the F distribution, and 10 and 100 are parameters that specify how “peaked” the distribution is.\n\nset.seed(1)\nrandom_numbers = rf(1000, 10, 100)\n\nWrite code that gives you the sum of random_numbers and saves it to a new variable called numbers_sum:\nHint: To sum the numbers in a vector, use the sum() function.\nNote: You don’t automatically see the output of numbers_sum when you assign it to a variable. Type numbers_sum into the console and run it to see the value that you assigned it.\nWrite code that gives you the number of items in the random_numbers vector and saves it to a new variable called numbers_count:\nHint: To count the number of items in a vector, use the length() function.\nNow write code that uses the above two variables to calculate the average of random_numbers and assign it to a new variable called this_mean.\nWhat number did you get? It should have been 1.018. If it isn’t, double check your code!\nR actually has a built in function to calculate the mean for you, so you don’t have to remember how to build it from scratch each time! Check your above answer by using the mean() function on the random_numbers vector.\n\n\nCalculating the Standard Deviation\nNow that you’ve got that under your fingers, let’s move on to standard deviation.\nWe will be converting the following formula for calculating the sample standard deviation into code:\n\\(s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2} {n-1}}\\)\nFor this, we’ll review the concept of vectorization. This means that an operation like subtraction will act on all numbers in a vector at the same time.\nSubtract this_mean from the random_numbers vector. Did each number in random_numbers change?\nTry to write the formula for standard deviation in R code using the sqrt(), sum(), and length() functions, along with other operators (^, /, -). Assign it to a new variable called this_sd. Watch out for your parentheses!\nWhat number did you get for this_sd, or the standard deviation of random_numbers? If you didn’t get 0.489704, recheck your code!\nR also has a built in function for standard deviation. Check if you calculated the standard deviation correctly by using the sd() function on the random_numbers vector.\n\n\n\nMaking a Histogram of Our Numbers\nWhat do these random numbers look like, anyway? We can use base plotting in R to visualize the distribution of our random numbers.\nRun the following code to visualize the original distribution of random_numbers as a histogram.\n\nhist(random_numbers)\n\nNotice how most of the values are concentrated on the left-hand side of the graph, while there is a longer “tail” to the right? Counterintuitively, this is known as a right-skewed distribution. When we see a distribution like this, one common thing to do is to normalize it.\nThis is also known as calculating a z-score, which we will cover next.\n\n\nCalculating a Z-Score\nThe formula for calculating a z-score for a single value, or normalizing that value, is as follows:\n\\(z = \\frac{x - \\bar{x}}{s}\\)\nThis can be calculated for each value in random_numbers in context of the larger set of values.\nCan you translate this formula into code?\nUsing random_numbers, this_mean, and this_sd that are already in your environment, write a formula to transform all the values in random_numbers into z-scores, and assign it to the new variable normalized_data.\nHint: R is vectorized, so you can subtract the mean from each random number in random_numbers in a straightforward way.\nTake the mean of normalized_data and assign it to a variable called normalized_mean.\nNote: If you see something that ends in “e-16”, that means that it’s a very small decimal number (16 places to the right of the decimal point), and is essentially 0.\nTake the standard deviation of normalized_data and assign it to a variable called normalized_sd.\nWhat is the value of normalized_mean? What is the value of normalized_sd? You should get a vector that is mean zero and has a standard deviation of one, because the data has been normalized.\n\nMaking a Histogram of Z-scores\nLet’s plot the z-scores and see if our values are still skewed. How does this compare to the histogram of random_numbers? Run the following code:\n\nhist(normalized_data)\n\nIs the resulting data skewed?\n\n\n\n\nCalculating a T-Score\nT-tests are used to determine if two sample means are equal. The formula for calculating a t-score is as follows:\n\\(t = \\frac{\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}\\)\nwhere \\(\\overline{x}_i\\) is the mean of the first or second set of data, \\(s_i\\) is the sample standard deviation of the first or second set of data, and \\(n_i\\) is the sample size of the \\(i\\)th set of data.\nWe’ll first create two data sets of random numbers following a normal distribution:\n\nset.seed(1)\ndata_1 &lt;- rnorm(1000, 3)\ndata_2 &lt;- rnorm(100, 2)\n\nHere’s how we’ll calculate the mean (x_1), standard deviation (s_1), and sample size (n_1) of the first data set:\n\nx_1 &lt;- mean(data_1)\ns_1 &lt;- sd(data_1)\nn_1 &lt;- length(data_1)\n\nWhat numeric types do you get from doing this? Try running the typeof() function on each of x_1, s_1, and n_1. We have you started with x_1.\n\ntypeof(x_1)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nWhat object type is n_1?\nCan you calculate the same values for data_2, assigning mean, standard deviation, and length to the variables of x_2, s_2, and n_2, respectively?\nWhat values do you get for x_2 and s_2?\nNow, you should be able to translate the t-score formula (\\(\\frac{\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}\\)) into code, based on the above calculated values.\nWhat did you get for the t-score? You should have gotten 9.243, if not, double check your code!\nThe t-score’s meaning depends on your sample size, but in general t-scores close to 0 imply that the means are not statistically distinguishable, and large t-scores (e.g. t &gt; 3) imply the data have different means.\n\nPerforming a T-Test\nOnce again, R has a built in function that will perform a T-test for us, aptly named t.test(). Look up the arguments the function t.test() takes, and perform a T-test on data_1 and data_2.\nWhat are the sample means, and are they distinguishable from each other?\nWell done! You’ve learned how to work with R to calculate basic statistics. We’ve had you generate a few by hand, but be sure to use the built-in functions in R in the future.\nWant to improve this tutorial?

The most common structure for your code will look like the following code. This can be simplified if you are not storing results.\n\n# what are you iterating over? The vector from -10:10\nitems_to_iterate_over &lt;- c(-10:10) \n\n# pre-allocate the results\nout &lt;- rep(0, length(items_to_iterate_over))\n# write the iteration statement --\n# we'll use indices so we can store the output easily \nfor (i in seq_along(items_to_iterate_over)) {\n# do something\n# we capture the median of three random numbers\n# from normal distributions various means\n    out[[i]] &lt;- median(rnorm(n = 3,mean = items_to_iterate_over[[i]]))\n    }\n\n\nWriting for-loops\n\nWrite a for-loop that prints the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, 250000.\nWrite a for-loop that iterates over the indices of x and prints the ith value of x.\n\n\nx &lt;- c(5, 10, 15, 20, 250000)\n# replace the ... with the relevant code\n\nfor (i in ... ){ \n  print(x[[...]])\n  }\n\n\nWrite a for-loop that simplifies the following code so that you don’t repeat yourself! Don’t worry about storing the output yet. Use print() so that you can see the output. What happens if you don’t use print()?\n\n\nsd(rnorm(5))\nsd(rnorm(10))\nsd(rnorm(15))\nsd(rnorm(20)) \nsd(rnorm(25000))\n\n\nadjust your for-loop to see how the sd changes when you use rnorm(n, mean = 4)\nadjust your for-loop to see how the sd changes when you use rnorm(n, sd = 4)\n\n\nNow store the results of your for-loop above in a vector. Pre-allocate a vector of length 5 to capture the standard deviations.\n\n\n\nvectorization vs for loops\nRecall, vectorized functions operate on a vector item by item. It’s like looping over the vector! The following for-loop is better written vectorized.\nCompare the loop version\n\nnames &lt;- c(\"Marlene\", \"Jacob\", \"Buddy\")\nout &lt;- character(length(names))\n\nfor (i in seq_along(names)) {\n  out[[i]] &lt;- paste0(\"Welcome \", names[[i]])\n  }\n\nto the vectorized version\n\nnames &lt;- c(\"Marlene\", \"Jacob\", \"Buddy\") \nout &lt;- paste0(\"Welcome \", names)\n\nThe vectorized code is preferred because it is easier to write and read, and is possibly more efficient.\n\nRewrite your first for-loop, where you printed 5, 10, 15, 20, 250000 as vectorised code\nRewrite this for-loop as vectorized code:\n\n\nradii &lt;- c(0:10)\n\narea &lt;- double(length(radii)) \n\nfor (i in seq_along(radii)) { \n  area[[i]] &lt;- pi * radii[[i]] ^ 2 \n  }\n\n\nRewrite this for-loop as vectorized code:\n\n\nradii &lt;- c(-1:10)\n\narea &lt;- double(length(radii))\n\nfor (i in seq_along(radii)) { \n  if (radii[[i]] &lt; 0) { \n    area[[i]] &lt;- NaN \n  } else {\n      area[[i]] &lt;- pi * radii[[i]] ^ 2 }\n  }\n\n\n\n\nExtension\n\nSimulating the Law of Large Numbers\nThe Law of Large Numbers says that as sample sizes increase, the mean of the sample will approach the true mean of the distribution. We are going to simulate this phenomenon!\nWe’ll start by making a vector of sample sizes from 1 to 50, to represent increasing sample sizes.\nCreate a vector called sample_sizes that is made up of the numbers 1 through 50. (Hint: You can use seq() or : notation).\nWe’ll make an empty tibble to store the results of the for loop:\n\nestimates &lt;- tibble(n = integer(), sample_mean = double())\n\nWrite a loop over the sample_sizes you specified above. In the loop, for each sample size you will:\n\nCalculate the mean of a sample from the random normal distribution with mean = 0 and sd = 5.\nMake an intermediate tibble to store the results\nAppend the intermediate tibble to your tibble using bind_rows().\n\n\nset.seed(60637) \nfor (___ in ___) {\n  # Calculate the mean of a sample from the random normal distribution with mean = 0 and s\n  ___ &lt;- ___\n  # Make a tibble with your estimates\n  this_estimate &lt;- tibble(n = ___, sample_mean = ___) \n  # Append the new rows to your tibble\n  ___ &lt;- bind_rows(estimates, ___)\n  }\n\nWe can use ggplot2 to view the results. Fill in the correct information for the data and x and y variables, so that the n column of the estimates tibble is plotted on the x-axis, while the sample_mean column of the estimates tibble is plotted on the y-axis.\n\n# your data goes in the first position\n___ %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = ___, y = ___)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\nAs the sample size (n) increases, does the sample mean becomes closer to 0, or farther away from 0?\n\nRewrite the loop code without looking at your previous code and use a wider range of sample sizes. Try several different sample size combinations. What happens when you increase the sample size to 100? 500? 1000? Use the seq() function to generate a sensibly spaced sequence.\n\nset.seed(60637) \nsample_sizes &lt;- ___ \nestimates_larger_n &lt;- ___\n\nfor (___ in ___) {\n  ___ &lt;- ___\n  ___ &lt;- ___\n  ___ &lt;- ___\n}\n\n___ %&gt;%\n  ggplot(___(___ = ___, ___ = ___)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\nHow does this compare to before?\n\n\n\nExtending Our Simulation\nLooking at your results, you might think a small sample size is sufficient for estimating a mean, but your data had a relatively small standard deviation compared to the mean. Let’s run the same simulation as before with different standard deviations.\nDo the following:\n\nCreate a vector called population_sd of length 4 with values 1, 5, 10, and 20 (you’re welcome to add larger numbers if you wish).\nMake an empty tibble to store the output. Compared to before, this has an extra column for the changing population standard deviations.\nWrite a loop inside a loop over population_sd and then sample_sizes.\nThen, make a ggplot graph where the x and y axes are the same, but we facet (aka we create small multiples of individual graphs) on population_sd.\n\n\nset.seed(60637)\npopulation_sd &lt;- ___\n# use what every you came up with in the previous part \nsample_sizes &lt;- ___\nestimates_adjust_sd &lt;- ___\nfor (___ in ___){ \n  for (___ in ___) {\n    ___ &lt;- ___\n    ___ &lt;- ___\n    ___ &lt;- ___\n  } \n}\n\n___ %&gt;%\n  ggplot(___) +\n  geom_line() + \n  facet_wrap(~population_sd) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nHow do these estimates differ as you increase the standard deviation?\nWant to improve this tutorial?

    "text": "Lab 2\n\nGeneral Guidelines:\nYou will encounter a few functions we did not cover in the lecture video. This will give you some practice on how to use a new function for the first time. You can try following steps:\n\nStart by typing ?new_function in your Console to open up the help page\nRead the help page of this new_function. The description might be too technical for now. That’s OK. Pay attention to the Usage and Arguments, especially the argument x or x,y (when two arguments are required)\nAt the bottom of the help page, there are a few examples. Run the first few lines to see how it works\nApply it in your lab questions\n\nIt is highly likely that you will encounter error messages while doing this lab Here are a few steps that might help get you through it.\n\nLocate which line is causing this error first\nCheck if you may have a typo in the code. Sometimes another person can spot a typo faster than you.\nIf you enter the code without any typo, try googling the error message\nScroll through the top few links see if any of them helps\n\n\n\nWarm-up\n\nCreate a new Rmd and add code to load the tidyverse package.\nYour classmate comes to you and says they can’t get data to load after restarting their R session. You see the code:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"haven\")\nawesome_data &lt;- read_dta(\"awesome_data.dta\")\n\nError in read_dta(\"awesome_data.dta\") : could not find function \"read_dta\"\n\nDiagnose the problem.\nNote: If they say the code worked before, it’s likely they had loaded haven in the console or perhaps in an earlier script. R packages will stay attached as long as the R session is live.\n\nIn general, once you have successfully used install.packages(pkg) for a “pkg”, you won’t need to do it again. Install haven and readxl using the console.\nIn your script, load haven and readxl. Notice that if you had to restart R right now. You could reproduce the entire warm-up by running the script. We strive for reproducibility by keeping the code we want organized in scripts or Rmds.\nIt’s good practice when starting a new project to clear your R environment. This helps you make sure you are not relying on data or functions you wrote in another project. After you library() statements add the following code rm(list = ls()).\nrm() is short for remove. Find the examples in ?rm and run them in the console.\n\n\n\nISLR Chapter 2 Q8\nThis exercise relates to the College data set, which can be found in the file College.csv. It contains a number of variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US. The variables are\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPrivate\nPublic/private indicator\n\n\nApps\nNumber of applications received\n\n\nAccept\nNumber of applicants accepted\n\n\nEnroll\nNumber of new students enrolled\n\n\nTop10perc\nNew students from top 10 % of high school class\n\n\nTop25perc\nNew students from top 25 % of high school class\n\n\nF.Undergrad\nNumber of full-time undergraduates\n\n\nP.Undergrad\nNumber of part-time undergraduates\n\n\nOutstate\nOut-of-state tuition\n\n\nRoom.Board\nRoom and board costs\n\n\nBooks\nEstimated book costs\n\n\nPersonal\nEstimated personal spending\n\n\nPhD\nPercent of faculty with Ph.D.’s\n\n\nTerminal\nPercent of faculty with terminal degree\n\n\nS.F.Ratio\nStudent/faculty ratio\n\n\nperc.alumni\nPercent of alumni who donate\n\n\nExpend\nInstructional expenditure per student\n\n\nGrad.Rate\nGraduation rate\n\n\n\nBefore reading the data into R, it can be viewed in Excel or a text editor. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data.\n\nUse the base R read.csv() function to read the data into R with option stringsAsFactors=T (this is needed later on for plotting figures). Call the loaded data college.\nLook at the data using the View() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. Load your data and then try the following commands:\n\n\n#set your working directory ,fill in your code after this line\n\n#read in the file College.csv using read.csv() with option `stringsAsFactors=T`\ncollege &lt;- read.csv('College.csv', stringsAsFactors = T)\n\n#Give data frame college rownames\nrownames(college) &lt;- college[,1] \n\n# Please comment out View function after using it. Otherwise you'll see some error when knit.\n# View(college)\n\n\nYou should see that there is now a row.names column with the name of each university recorded. This means that R has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R will not try to perform calculations on the row names. Next, we will remove the first column in the data where the names are stored. Try\n\n\n#Use a negative number to generate a subset with all but one column\n# college[, -c(1, 2, 3)]  will generate a subset with all but the first three columns\ncollege &lt;- college[,-1]\n# as.factor can turn a character column to a factor column so that we can use it to plot later on\ncollege$Private &lt;- as.factor(college$Private)\n#View(college)\n\nNow you should see that the first data column is Private. Note that another column labeled row.names now appears before the Private column. However, this is not a data column but rather the name that R is giving to each row.\n\nUse the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set. Hint: summary() takes in an object such as data.frame and return the summery results\nUse the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the first five columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first five columns of a data frame dat using dat[,1:5]\nUse the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private. Hint: plot() takes two arguments one vector for x axis and one vector for y axis. Try plot(dat$col_name, dat$col_name).\n\n\n# replicate \"No\" for the same times as the number of colleges using rep()\nElite &lt;- rep(\"No\",nrow(college))\n# change the values in Elite for colleges with proportion of students \n# coming from the top 10% of their high school classes \n# exceeds 50 % to \"Yes\"\nElite[college$Top10perc &gt;50] &lt;- \"Yes\"\n# as.factor change ELite, a character vector to a factor vector\n# (we will touch on factors later in class) \nElite &lt;- as.factor(Elite)\n# add the newly created vector to the college data frame\ncollege &lt;- data.frame(college ,Elite)\n\n\nUse the summary() function to see how many elite universities there are. Now use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Elite.\n\nContinue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.\n\n\nISLR Chapter 2 Q9\nThis exercise involves the Auto data set. na.omit() removes the missing values from the data and returns a new data frame.\n\n#load the Auto.csv into a variable called auto using read_csv()\n\n\n# remove all rows with missing values using na.omit()\nauto &lt;- na.omit(auto)\n\nWe can use class() to check which of the columns are quantitative (numeric or integer), and which are qualitative( logical or character). And sapply() function takes in a data frame and a function (in this case class()), apply the class function to each column. Try the following commands:\n\n#apply the class() function to each column of auto data frame\nsapply(auto, class)\n\n\nWhat is the range of each quantitative columns? You can answer this using the range() function. Hint: You can call range() function individually on each column. You can also subset the quantitative columns by creating a variable quant_cols equal to all columns with a numeric mode, then use sapply the function range() with the data frame with only quantitative columns. This is not required.\nUsing the functions mean() and sd(). Find out what is the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative columns?\nNow remove the 10th through 85th observations (rows). What is the range, mean, and standard deviation of each column in the subset of the data that remains? Hint: We’ve seen removing columns in question 8. To remove the rows, we can use the negative sign - again. For example, auto[-c(1,3),] removes the first and third row\nUsing the full data set, investigate the columns graphically, using scatterplots (pairs or plot) or other tools of your choice. Create some plots highlighting the relationships among the columns Comment on your findings.\nSuppose that we wish to predict gas mileage (mpg) on the basis of the other numerical variables. Do your plots suggest that any of the other variables might be useful in predicting mpg? Justify your answer.\n\n\n\nISLR Chapter 2 Q10\nThis exercise involves the Boston housing data set.\nTo begin, load in the Boston data set. The Boston data set is part of the MASS library in R. You may need to install the package using install.packages() function if you haven’t done so.\n\n# install.packages(MASS)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\nNow the data set is contained in the object Boston.\n\nBoston\n\nRead about the data set:\n\n?Boston\n\n\nHow many rows are in this data set? How many columns? What do the rows and columns represent?\nMake some pairwise scatterplots of the columns in this data set. Describe your findings. Hint: Use function pairs()\nHow many of the suburbs in this data set bound the Charles river? Hint: Subset the data using a logical vector to check if variable chas==1, then use nrow() to see the number of suburbs.\nUsing median(), find out what is the median pupil-teacher ratio among the towns in this data set?\n\nWell done!

    "title": "DIY Decision Trees",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Decision trees are a fundamental machine learning algorithm that’s easy to understand and interpret. They’re a popular choice for classification and regression tasks, offering a visual representation of the decision-making process. In this series, we’ll explore the inner workings of decision trees, starting with the basics and gradually building up to more advanced concepts.\n\n\nWhy go through the trouble of building a machine learning algorithm by hand, especially when libraries like sklearn in Python or rpart in R are just a function call away? The answer lies in the deeper understanding and insights that come from peeling back the layers of these algorithms ourselves.\n\n\n\nBeyond the theoretical, there’s immense practical value in understanding the inner workings of these models. It allows for more informed decisions about feature selection—knowing which to discard because they don’t fit the model’s assumptions and which to transform for better representation. This knowledge often translates to improved model performance on new, unseen data.\nAnd let’s not overlook the sheer joy of the process. Diving deep into algorithms offers a unique way to tackle problem-solving, enhancing our execution and grasp of machine learning concepts.\n\n\n\nHow do we navigate through the countless ways to split our data? We turn to optimization metrics, the compass guiding each iteration towards better performance. For decision trees, two key metrics stand out: Gini Impurity and Entropy.\n\n\nGini Impurity is an insightful metric focused on misclassification. It hinges on the probability of classifying a data point correctly within our dataset. For any given class \\(c\\) with frequency \\(f_c\\), we predict that class for a data point \\(f_c\\) proportion of the time. The error for each class is the chance of selecting the class multiplied by the likelihood of being incorrect:\n\\[Error_c = f_c \\times (1 - f_c)\\]\nThe Gini Impurity is the aggregate of these individual errors across all classes:\n\\[Gini\\ Impurity = \\sum_c f_c \\times (1 - f_c) = \\sum_c f_c - \\sum_c f_c^2 = 1 - \\sum_c f_c^2\\]\nImproving the Gini Impurity, specifically by minimizing it across data regions, directly leads to a reduction in misclassification.\n\n\n\nConsider the Gini Impurity of a coin flip, where the probability of heads is \\(p_H\\):\n\\[Gini\\ Impurity = 1 - p_H^2 - (1 - p_H)^2 = 2 \\times p_H \\times (1 - p_H)\\]\n\np &lt;- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)\nplot(p, 1-p^2-(1-p)^2, type='l', ylim=c(0,1), \n     ylab = \"Gini Impurity\", xlab=\"Probability of Heads\", \n     col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nWhen \\(p_H\\) is at 0 or 1, there’s no chance of error—our predictions are certain. Yet at \\(p_H = 0.5\\), Gini Impurity peaks, reflecting the highest error rate and aligning with our intuitive understanding.\n\n\n\nEntropy, on the other hand, takes a different tack. It measures the expected information content—or surprise—of a class in a dataset. If \\(f_c\\) is the proportion of a class, and \\(I(c)\\) represents the information content of the class, then entropy is defined as:\n\\[Entropy = \\sum_c f_c \\times I(c)\\]\nWithout delving too deep into the underlying theory, the formula for entropy, given that \\(I(c) = -\\log_2(f_c)\\), simplifies to:\n\\[Entropy = -\\sum_c f_c \\times \\log_2(f_c)\\]\nThough the logarithm base could be arbitrary, we align it with the binary nature of the decision trees we’re examining in this series.\n\n\n\nExtending our analogy to the coin toss, let’s examine how entropy changes with varying probabilities of heads, \\(p_H\\):\n\\[Entropy = -p_H \\log_2(p_H) - (1 - p_H) \\log_2(1 - p_H)\\]\n\np &lt;- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)\nplot(p, -p*log2(p)-(1-p)*log2(1-p), type='l', ylim=c(0,1), \n     ylab = \"Entropy\", xlab=\"Probability of Heads\", col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nEntropy achieves its maximum at \\(p_H = 0.5\\), where uncertainty—and the potential for error—is greatest. This resonates with the principle that the greatest entropy occurs where prediction is most challenging.\n\n\n\n\nWith our metrics in place to judge how well our dataset’s predictions are doing, it’s time to focus on improvement—how can we make our predictions even better? We’re going to talk about something called ‘Information Gain’, a concept which is the difference we want to maximize when deciding how to split our data.\n\n\nWhen we build a classifier—a kind of decision tree—our goal is to organize our data into groups that make our predictions as accurate as possible. The concept of ‘Information Gain’ is a bit like a treasure map; it helps us find these valuable groupings by measuring how much more ordered, or less chaotic, our data becomes after a split.\n\\[Information\\ Gain = Gini\\ Impurity_{before\\ split} - \\sum_{each\\ split} \\frac{|split\\ group|}{|total\\ data|} Gini\\ Impurity_{split\\ group}\\]\n\\[Information\\ Gain = Entropy_{before\\ split} - \\sum_{each\\ split} \\frac{|split\\ group|}{|total\\ data|} Entropy_{split\\ group}\\]\nIn these equations, \\(Gini\\ Impurity_{before\\ split}\\) and \\(Entropy_{before\\ split}\\) represent the disorder in our data before any splits. The sum of the Gini Impurity or Entropy of each split group is weighted by the proportion of data in that group. The Information Gain is the difference between the disorder before the split and the weighted sum of disorder after the split.\nIn essence, it tells us how much clearer our predictions become after we’ve sorted the data into separate buckets based on certain features.\n\n\n\nA common pitfall with decision trees is that they can get a little too enthusiastic, creating very specific rules that work perfectly for the data they were trained on but not so well for new data. This is known as overfitting.\nTo avoid this, we can trim or ‘prune’ the tree after it’s grown, or we can set some ground rules that stop the tree from getting overly complicated in the first place.

We use a mask—a logical vector indicating if a row belongs to the first or second partition—to guide this process:\n\ninformation_gain &lt;- function(y, mask, metric_func = entropy) {\n  # We don't want partitions with no data points\n  if (sum(mask) == 0 || sum(!mask) == 0) return(0)\n  metric_func(y) - (sum(mask) / length(mask)) * metric_func(y[mask]) - \n    (sum(!mask) / length(!mask)) * metric_func(y[!mask])\n}\n\n\n\n\nWith our metric functions in hand, we’ll comb through all the features to find the ultimate split:\n\nmax_information_gain_split &lt;- function(y, x, metric_func = gini_impurity) {\n  # Initialize the best change and split value\n  best_change &lt;- NA\n  split_value &lt;- NA\n  # Check if the feature is numeric or categorical\n  is_numeric &lt;- !(is.factor(x) || is.logical(x) || is.character(x))\n\n  for(val in sort(unique(x))) {\n    mask &lt;- if (is_numeric) { x &lt; val } else { x == val }\n    change &lt;- information_gain(y, mask, metric_func)\n    if(is.na(best_change) || change &gt; best_change) {\n      best_change &lt;- change\n      split_value &lt;- val\n    }\n  }\n\n  return(list(\"best_change\" = best_change, \"split_value\" = split_value, \"is_numeric\" = is_numeric))\n}\n\nNow, let’s use this to find the best split for a single feature:\n\nprint(max_information_gain_split(iris$Species, iris$Petal.Width))\n\n$best_change\n[1] 0.3333333\n\n$split_value\n[1] 1\n\n$is_numeric\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nsapply(iris[, 1:4], function(x) max_information_gain_split(iris$Species, x))\n\n            Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nbest_change 0.2277603    0.1269234   0.3333333    0.3333333  \nsplit_value 5.5          3.4         3            1          \nis_numeric  TRUE         TRUE        TRUE         TRUE       \n\n\nAfter determining the feature and value that provide the most significant information gain, we can then carve our dataset into two distinct sets. Think of it like sorting a deck of cards where one feature is the deciding factor.\n\nbest_feature_split &lt;- function(X, y) {\n  results &lt;- sapply(X, function(x) max_information_gain_split(y, x))\n  best_name &lt;- names(which.max(results['best_change',]))\n  best_result &lt;- results[, best_name]\n  best_result[[\"name\"]] &lt;- best_name\n  return(best_result)\n}\n\nLet’s run it for the iris dataset and see which feature provides the best split.\n\nas.data.frame(best_feature_split(iris[, 1:4], iris[, 5]))\n\n  best_change split_value is_numeric         name\n1   0.3333333           3       TRUE Petal.Length\n\n\nThis neat little function sifts through our data and finds the golden split—the point where dividing our dataset yields the most clarity according to our chosen metric.\nNow, imagine we’ve found our winning feature. The next step is to partition the iris dataset into two new datasets based on this feature. We’ll refer to them as ‘left’ and ‘right’ datasets, aligning with the branching structure of a tree.\n\nget_best_mask &lt;- function(X, best_feature_list) {\n  best_mask &lt;- X[, best_feature_list$name] &lt; best_feature_list$split_value\n  return(best_mask)\n}\n\nWe’ll get the best mask and split the iris dataset accordingly.\n\nbest_iris_split &lt;- best_feature_split(iris[, 1:4], iris[, 5])\nbest_iris_mask &lt;- get_best_mask(iris[, 1:4], best_iris_split)\n\nPartition the iris dataset into ‘left’ and ‘right’\n\nleft_iris &lt;- iris[best_iris_mask, ]\nright_iris &lt;- iris[!best_iris_mask, ]\n\nAnd just like that, with our data now split into ‘left’ and ‘right’, we’ve taken the first step in constructing our decision tree. This process will serve as the foundation for building a data structure that captures the essence of our tree, complete with branches that stem from each decision point."

For simplicity, let’s assume the distribution of our target variable within smokers and non-smokers is as follows:\n\nSmokers (S=1): 3 have the condition (1), 1 does not (0).\nNon-Smokers (S=0): 2 have the condition (1), 4 do not (0).\n\n\n\nFirst, calculate the proportions of each class within smokers:\n\nProportion of having the condition (1): \\(p_1 = \\frac{3}{4}\\)\nProportion of not having the condition (0): \\(p_0 = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nThen, the Gini impurity for smokers can be calculated as:\n\\[\nGini_{\\text{Smokers}} = 1 - (p_1^2 + p_0^2) = 1 - \\left(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{1}{16}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{10}{16} = \\frac{6}{16} = 0.375\n\\]\n\n\n\nNext, calculate the proportions of each class within non-smokers:\n\nProportion of having the condition (1): \\(p_1 = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\nProportion of not having the condition (0): \\(p_0 = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\nThen, the Gini impurity for non-smokers can be calculated as:\n\\[\nGini_{\\text{Non-Smokers}} = 1 - (p_1^2 + p_0^2) = 1 - \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{4}{9}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{4}{9} \\approx 0.444\n\\]\n\n\n\nTo determine the optimal feature to split on, we calculate the weighted Gini impurity for the entire dataset before the split and compare it with the weighted average Gini impurity after the split. The split that results in the greatest decrease in impurity is considered optimal.\nGiven the Gini impurities calculated for both groups, we calculate the weighted average Gini impurity for splitting on “Smoker”:\n\\[\n\\text{Weighted Gini} = \\frac{4}{10} \\times Gini_{\\text{Smokers}} + \\frac{6}{10} \\times Gini_{\\text{Non-Smokers}} = \\frac{4}{10} \\times 0.375 + \\frac{6}{10} \\times 0.444 \\approx 0.416\n\\]\nAssuming this is the lowest weighted Gini impurity compared to other features, splitting on “Smoker” would be considered the optimal choice at this node.\nIn this detailed example, we’ve seen how to calculate Gini impurity by hand for a simple dataset, providing insights into the decision-making process within a decision tree algorithm. Next, we will implement this decision tree in R and verify our manual calculations."

    "text": "Metrics: Navigating Improvement in Decision Trees\nIn the journey of machine learning, each algorithm strives for perfection through iteration, continuously improving upon a specific measure or metric. Decision trees are no exception. To steer this algorithm correctly, we must first establish the criteria it aims to optimize.\n\nClassification Metrics for Decision Trees\n\nGini Impurity\nGini Impurity is an insightful metric focused on misclassification. It hinges on the probability of classifying a data point correctly within our dataset. For any given class \\(c\\) with frequency \\(f_c\\), we predict that class for a data point \\(f_c\\) proportion of the time. The error for each class is the chance of selecting the class multiplied by the likelihood of being incorrect:\n\\[Error_c = f_c \\times (1 - f_c)\\]\nThe Gini Impurity is the aggregate of these individual errors across all classes:\n\\[Gini\\ Impurity = \\sum_c f_c \\times (1 - f_c) = \\sum_c f_c - \\sum_c f_c^2 = 1 - \\sum_c f_c^2\\]\nImproving the Gini Impurity, specifically by minimizing it across data regions, directly leads to a reduction in misclassification.\n\n\nGini Impurity Illustrated with a Coin Toss\nConsider the Gini Impurity of a coin flip, where the probability of heads is \\(p_H\\):\n\\[Gini\\ Impurity = 1 - p_H^2 - (1 - p_H)^2 = 2 \\times p_H \\times (1 - p_H)\\]\n\np &lt;- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)\nplot(p, 1-p^2-(1-p)^2, type='l', ylim=c(0,1), \n     ylab = \"Gini Impurity\", xlab=\"Probability of Heads\", \n     col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nWhen \\(p_H\\) is at 0 or 1, there’s no chance of error—our predictions are certain. Yet at \\(p_H = 0.5\\), Gini Impurity peaks, reflecting the highest error rate and aligning with our intuitive understanding.\n\n\nEntropy\nEntropy, on the other hand, takes a different tack. It measures the expected information content—or surprise—of a class in a dataset. If \\(f_c\\) is the proportion of a class, and \\(I(c)\\) represents the information content of the class, then entropy is defined as:\n\\[Entropy = \\sum_c f_c \\times I(c)\\]\nWithout delving too deep into the underlying theory, the formula for entropy, given that \\(I(c) = -\\log_2(f_c)\\), simplifies to:\n\\[Entropy = -\\sum_c f_c \\times \\log_2(f_c)\\]\nThough the logarithm base could be arbitrary, we align it with the binary nature of the decision trees we’re examining in this series.\n\n\nEntropy in the Context of a Coin Toss\nExtending our analogy to the coin toss, let’s examine how entropy changes with varying probabilities of heads, \\(p_H\\):\n\\[Entropy = -p_H \\log_2(p_H) - (1 - p_H) \\log_2(1 - p_H)\\]\n\np &lt;- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)\nplot(p, -p*log2(p)-(1-p)*log2(1-p), type='l', ylim=c(0,1), \n     ylab = \"Entropy\", xlab=\"Probability of Heads\", col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nEntropy achieves its maximum at \\(p_H = 0.5\\), where uncertainty—and the potential for error—is greatest. This resonates with the principle that the greatest entropy occurs where prediction is most challenging.\nRefining Our Approach with Information Gain\nWith our metrics in place to judge how well our dataset’s predictions are doing, it’s time to focus on improvement—how can we make our predictions even better? We’re going to talk about something called ‘Information Gain’, a concept which is the difference we want to maximize when deciding how to split our data.\nFine-tuning a Decision Tree for Classification\nWhen we build a classifier—a kind of decision tree—our goal is to organize our data into groups that make our predictions as accurate as possible. The concept of ‘Information Gain’ is a bit like a treasure map; it helps us find these valuable groupings by measuring how much more ordered, or less chaotic, our data becomes after a split.\n\\[Information\\ Gain = Gini\\ Impurity_{before\\ split} - \\sum_{each\\ split} \\frac{|split\\ group|}{|total\\ data|} Gini\\ Impurity_{split\\ group}\\]\n\\[Information\\ Gain = Entropy_{before\\ split} - \\sum_{each\\ split} \\frac{|split\\ group|}{|total\\ data|} Entropy_{split\\ group}\\]\nIn these equations, \\(Gini\\ Impurity_{before\\ split}\\) and \\(Entropy_{before\\ split}\\) represent the disorder in our data before any splits. The sum of the Gini Impurity or Entropy of each split group is weighted by the proportion of data in that group. The Information Gain is the difference between the disorder before the split and the weighted sum of disorder after the split.\nIn essence, it tells us how much clearer our predictions become after we’ve sorted the data into separate buckets based on certain features.\nBalancing Decision Trees to Avoid Overfitting\nA common pitfall with decision trees is that they can get a little too enthusiastic, creating very specific rules that work perfectly for the data they were trained on but not so well for new data. This is known as overfitting.\nTo avoid this, we can trim or ‘prune’ the tree after it’s grown, or we can set some ground rules that stop the tree from getting overly complicated in the first place. These rules can include limits like:\n\nMaximum depth of the tree\nMinimum number of data points to justify creating a new branch\nMinimum improvement needed to make a new split\nA threshold below which we won’t consider any new splits\n\nThe Iris Dataset: Our Classification Playground We’ll be using the well-loved Iris dataset for classification tasks. The Species attribute will be our target for prediction. Here’s a peek at the dataset:\n\nlibrary(datasets)\ndata(iris)\nhead(iris, 6)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\nBy using the Iris dataset, we can focus on classifying flower species, a perfect starting point for practicing with decision trees.\nBuilding the Classifier: The Search for the First Split In our script, we’re not just taking wild guesses.

    "text": "How do we navigate through the countless ways to split our data? We turn to optimization metrics, the compass guiding each iteration towards better performance. For decision trees, two key metrics stand out: Gini Impurity and Entropy.\n\n\nGini Impurity is an insightful metric focused on misclassification. It hinges on the probability of classifying a data point correctly within our dataset. For any given class \\(c\\) with frequency \\(f_c\\), we predict that class for a data point \\(f_c\\) proportion of the time. The error for each class is the chance of selecting the class multiplied by the likelihood of being incorrect:\n\\[Error_c = f_c \\times (1 - f_c)\\]\nThe Gini Impurity is the aggregate of these individual errors across all classes:\n\\[Gini\\ Impurity = \\sum_c f_c \\times (1 - f_c) = \\sum_c f_c - \\sum_c f_c^2 = 1 - \\sum_c f_c^2\\]\nImproving the Gini Impurity, specifically by minimizing it across data regions, directly leads to a reduction in misclassification.\n\n\n\nConsider the Gini Impurity of a coin flip, where the probability of heads is \\(p_H\\):\n\\[Gini\\ Impurity = 1 - p_H^2 - (1 - p_H)^2 = 2 \\times p_H \\times (1 - p_H)\\]\n\np &lt;- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)\nplot(p, 1-p^2-(1-p)^2, type='l', ylim=c(0,1), \n     ylab = \"Gini Impurity\", xlab=\"Probability of Heads\", \n     col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nWhen \\(p_H\\) is at 0 or 1, there’s no chance of error—our predictions are certain. Yet at \\(p_H = 0.5\\), Gini Impurity peaks, reflecting the highest error rate and aligning with our intuitive understanding.\n\n\n\nEntropy, on the other hand, takes a different tack. It measures the expected information content—or surprise—of a class in a dataset. If \\(f_c\\) is the proportion of a class, and \\(I(c)\\) represents the information content of the class, then entropy is defined as:\n\\[Entropy = \\sum_c f_c \\times I(c)\\]\nWithout delving too deep into the underlying theory, the formula for entropy, given that \\(I(c) = -\\log_2(f_c)\\), simplifies to:\n\\[Entropy = -\\sum_c f_c \\times \\log_2(f_c)\\]\nThough the logarithm base could be arbitrary, we align it with the binary nature of the decision trees we’re examining in this series.\n\n\n\nExtending our analogy to the coin toss, let’s examine how entropy changes with varying probabilities of heads, \\(p_H\\):\n\\[Entropy = -p_H \\log_2(p_H) - (1 - p_H) \\log_2(1 - p_H)\\]\n\np &lt;- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)\nplot(p, -p*log2(p)-(1-p)*log2(1-p), type='l', ylim=c(0,1), \n     ylab = \"Entropy\", xlab=\"Probability of Heads\", col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nEntropy achieves its maximum at \\(p_H = 0.5\\), where uncertainty—and the potential for error—is greatest. This resonates with the principle that the greatest entropy occurs where prediction is most challenging."

    "text": "With our metrics in place to judge how well our dataset’s predictions are doing, it’s time to focus on improvement—how can we make our predictions even better? We’re going to talk about something called ‘Information Gain’, a concept which is the difference we want to maximize when deciding how to split our data.\n\n\nWhen we build a classifier—a kind of decision tree—our goal is to organize our data into groups that make our predictions as accurate as possible. The concept of ‘Information Gain’ is a bit like a treasure map; it helps us find these valuable groupings by measuring how much more ordered, or less chaotic, our data becomes after a split.\n\\[Information\\ Gain = Gini\\ Impurity_{before\\ split} - \\sum_{each\\ split} \\frac{|split\\ group|}{|total\\ data|} Gini\\ Impurity_{split\\ group}\\]\n\\[Information\\ Gain = Entropy_{before\\ split} - \\sum_{each\\ split} \\frac{|split\\ group|}{|total\\ data|} Entropy_{split\\ group}\\]\nIn these equations, \\(Gini\\ Impurity_{before\\ split}\\) and \\(Entropy_{before\\ split}\\) represent the disorder in our data before any splits. The sum of the Gini Impurity or Entropy of each split group is weighted by the proportion of data in that group. The Information Gain is the difference between the disorder before the split and the weighted sum of disorder after the split.\nIn essence, it tells us how much clearer our predictions become after we’ve sorted the data into separate buckets based on certain features.\n\n\n\nA common pitfall with decision trees is that they can get a little too enthusiastic, creating very specific rules that work perfectly for the data they were trained on but not so well for new data. This is known as overfitting.\nTo avoid this, we can trim or ‘prune’ the tree after it’s grown, or we can set some ground rules that stop the tree from getting overly complicated in the first place. These rules can include limits like:\n\nMaximum depth of the tree\nMinimum number of data points to justify creating a new branch\nMinimum improvement needed to make a new split\nA threshold below which we won’t consider any new splits"

    "text": "Tree-Based Methods\nTree-based methods are non-parametric supervised learning methods that stratify or segment the predictor space into a number of simple regions. They can be used for both regression and clas- sification. After building a tree using the training data, a prediction can be made by using the training observations in the region to which the new observation belongs. For a regression tree, the predicted response for an observation is given by the mean response of the training observations that belong to the same terminal node. In contrast, for a classification tree, we predict that each observation belongs to the most commonly occurring class of training observations in the region to which it belongs. Decision trees are simple and useful for interpretation. However, they typically have lower predictive power than other supervised learning methods. Bagging, random forests, and boosting are approaches to improve decision trees by involving multiple trees, which are then combined to yield a single consensus prediction. These approaches can dramatically improve the prediction accuracy of decision trees, at the expense of interpretability.\n\nDecision Trees\nTo interpret a decision tree, suppose we have below tree from the Hitters data. The Figure represents a regression tree for predicting the log salary of a baseball player, based on the two predictors—the number of years that he has played in the major leagues and the number of hits that he made in the previous year. We can read the tree sequentially from top to bottom. At a given node (where the branches split), the label (of the form \\(X_j &lt; t_k\\)) indicates the left-hand branch emanating from that split, and the right-hand branch corresponds to \\(X_j \\geq t_k\\). For instance, the split at the top of the tree results in two large branches. The left-hand branch corresponds to \\(Years &lt; 4.5\\) and the right-hand branch corresponds to \\(Years \\geq 4.5\\). The number in each leaf (terminal nodes) is the mean of the response (outcomes) for the observations (in the training data) that fall there.\n\n\n\nDecision Tree Example\n\n\nDecision trees are easier to interpret and have a nice graphical representation. Unfortunately, fitting a decision tree is not simple. It is computationally infeasible to consider every possible partition of the feature space into \\(J\\) boxes. For this reason, we take a top-down, greedy approach that is known as recursive binary splitting. The approach is top-down because it begins at the top of the tree (at which point all observations belong to a single region) and then successively splits the predictor space; each split is indicated via two new branches further down on the tree. It is greedy because, at each step of the tree-building process, the best split is made at that particular step, rather than looking ahead and picking a split that will lead to a better tree in some future step. In order to perform recursive binary splitting, we first select the predictor \\(X_j\\) and the cutpoint \\(s\\) such that splitting the predictor space into the regions \\(\\{X|X_j &lt; s\\}\\) and \\(\\{X|X_j \\geq s\\}\\) leads to the greatest possible reduction in RSS. For building a classification tree, alternatives to RSS are the classification error rate, Gini index, and entropy. Instead of the error rate, either the Gini index or the entropy are typically used to evaluate the quality of a particular split, since these two approaches are more sensitive to node purity than is the classification error rate.\nAnother problem with the decision tree is that the process described above may produce good predictions on the training set but is likely to overfit the data, leading to poor test set performance. A better strategy is to grow a very large tree and then prune it back in order to obtain a subtree. We can use the cross validation to prune the tree.\nThe advantages of trees are the following: (1) trees are very easy to explain; (2) trees can be displayed graphically and are easily interpreted even by a non-expert; (3) trees can easily handle qualitative predictors without the need to create dummy variables. Disadvantages of trees are the following: (1) trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other regression and classification approaches; (2) trees can be very non-robust, i.e., a small change in the data can cause a large change in the final estimated tree.\n\n\nBagging\nBagging, random forests, and boosting are approaches to improve decision trees by involving multiple trees, which are then combined to yield a single consensus prediction. To apply bagging to regression trees, we simply construct \\(B\\) regression trees using \\(B\\) bootstrapped training sets and average the resulting predictions. These trees are grown deep and are not pruned. Because the tree is not pruned, it means each tree is more flexible, hence high variance but low bias. Averaging these \\(B\\) trees reduces the variance because in statistics, averaging a set of observations reduces variance. For bagging classification trees, we can record the class predicted by each of the \\(B\\) trees, and take a majority vote (i.e., the most commonly occurring class among the \\(B\\) predictions).\nWe can also obtain an overall summary of the importance of each predictor using the RSS (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging regression trees, we can record the total amount that the RSS is decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all \\(B\\) trees. A large value indicates an important predictor.\n\n\nRandom forests\nThe main difference between bagging and random forests is the choice of predictor subset size m. When building decision trees in random forests, each time a split in a tree is considered, a random sample of m predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of p predictors. If a random forest is built using \\(m = p\\), then this amounts simply to bagging. Random forests can provide an improvement over bagged trees by decorrelating the trees, i.e., forcing the tree to consider different splits and thus avoid the situation when all trees to have similar structures due to a small subset of strong predictors. In general, using a small value of m in building a random forest will typically be helpful when we have a large number of correlated predictors.\n\n\nBoosting\nIn boosting, each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees. Boosting does not involve bootstrap sampling, but instead, each tree is fit on a modified version of the original data set. Unlike in bagging, the construction of each tree depends strongly on the trees that have already been grown. Boosting involves the parameters that we have to determine. The shrinkage parameter \\(\\lambda\\), a small positive number, controls the rate at which boosting learns. Very small \\(\\lambda\\) can require using a very large value of B and thus achieve good performance. We also need to determine the number \\(d\\) of splits in each tree, which controls the complexity of the boosted ensemble. Similar to \\(\\lambda\\), a small \\(d\\) can typically achieve a slower learn, which means better performance."

For college, all columns except the first are numeric. The first column is a factor column, which means it’s categorical. To get a better sense of the data, let’s look at it:\n\nView(college_data)\n\nSuppose we are interested in predicting whether a college is private or public based on available covariates, like Number accepted, enrolled, etc. Additionally, let’s suppose you don’t want certain variables included in your dataset. You can drop these functions using -c(). For example, let’s suppose you don’t want the Apps or Student to Faculty Ratio included in your dataset.\n\ncollege_data &lt;- college_data[, -c(15, 2)]\n\nBe careful when you are dropping multiple columns. You need to put the numbers in reverse order (from highest to lowest). This is because if you drop the second column first, then the 15th column becomes the the 14th column.\n\ncollege_data &lt;- College\ncollege_data &lt;- college_data[, -c(2)]\ncollege_data &lt;- college_data[, -c(15)]\n\nA less manual way of dropping columns is to use R to first use R to find the corresponding indices in the data columns. Go back to the original college data\n\ncollege_data &lt;- College\n\nFind the indices (i.e. column positions) of the columns to drop\n\nto_drop &lt;- which(names(college_data) %in% c(\"Apps\", \"S.F.Ratio\"))\nprint(to_drop)\n\n[1]  2 15\n\n\nReverse the indices as suggested above\n\nto_drop &lt;- rev(to_drop)\nprint(to_drop)\n\n[1] 15  2\n\n\nNow use the object you have defined to drop the columns\n\ncollege_data &lt;- college_data[, -c(to_drop)]\n\nAlso sometimes we have factor variables that we want to convert to numeric variables. To check variable types, you can use the “str” function\n\nstr(college_data)\n\n'data.frame':   777 obs. of  16 variables:\n $ Private    : Factor w/ 2 levels \"No\",\"Yes\": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Accept     : num  1232 1924 1097 349 146 ...\n $ Enroll     : num  721 512 336 137 55 158 103 489 227 172 ...\n $ Top10perc  : num  23 16 22 60 16 38 17 37 30 21 ...\n $ Top25perc  : num  52 29 50 89 44 62 45 68 63 44 ...\n $ F.Undergrad: num  2885 2683 1036 510 249 ...\n $ P.Undergrad: num  537 1227 99 63 869 ...\n $ Outstate   : num  7440 12280 11250 12960 7560 ...\n $ Room.Board : num  3300 6450 3750 5450 4120 ...\n $ Books      : num  450 750 400 450 800 500 500 450 300 660 ...\n $ Personal   : num  2200 1500 1165 875 1500 ...\n $ PhD        : num  70 29 53 92 76 67 90 89 79 40 ...\n $ Terminal   : num  78 30 66 97 72 73 93 100 84 41 ...\n $ perc.alumni: num  12 16 30 37 2 11 26 37 23 15 ...\n $ Expend     : num  7041 10527 8735 19016 10922 ...\n $ Grad.Rate  : num  60 56 54 59 15 55 63 73 80 52 ...\n\n\nYou can see that the Private variable is a factor. We can convert it to a numeric variable using the “as.numeric” function. I like my binary variables in R to be 0/1. In R, most factors automatically convert to a binary 1/2 format.

    "text": "Testing and Training Sets\nIn order to make this interesting, let’s split our data into a training set and a test set. To do this, we will use set.seed(), which will allow us to draw the same pseudorandom numbers the next time we run this code, and we will use the sample() function.\n\nset.seed(222)\n\nThe sample() function takes two arguments: The first is a vector of numbers from which to draw a random sample. The second is the number of random numbers to draw. The default is to sample without replacement, but you can sample with replacement by adding “, replace = TRUE” inside the function. Now, let’s generate a list of indices from the original dataset that will be designated part of the test set using sample()\n\ntest_ids &lt;- sample(1:(nrow(college_data)), round(0.2 * nrow(college_data)))\n\nTo identify the training_ids, we want all of the numbers from 1:nrow(college_data) that aren’t test IDs. Recall that which() returns the indices for which the statement inside the parentheses is true. which(!()) returns the indices for which the statement inside the parentheses is false. The “!” means “not”. Also, if you wanted to know which values of vector A were in vector B, you can use which(A %in% B). So if you want to know which values of vector A are NOT in vector B, you use which(!(A %in B)), so that’s what we will do – vector A is the vector of all integers between 1 and the number of rows in our data. vector B is the vector of test IDs\n\ntraining_ids &lt;- which(!(1:(nrow(college_data)) %in% test_ids))\n\nWe can use these indices to define our test and training sets by putting those vectors in the row position inside square brackets.\n\ntest_data &lt;- college_data[test_ids,]\ntraining_data &lt;- college_data[training_ids,]"

    "text": "KNN Classification\nLet’s develop a KNN model to try to predict whether it’s a private college using all available features.\nTo use KNN for classification, we need to install and load the library “class”\n\nlibrary(class)\n\nknn() is the function we will use to run the KNN model. It takes four arguments:\n\ntrain = training data features (no outcome)\ntest = test data features (no outcome)\ncl = training data outcome (class each observation belongs to)\nk = number of nearest neighbors to use\n\nFor two-class classification problems, k should be odd (avoids tied votes). Let’s run the model with 1 NN and 9 NNs. To exclude a column, use -# in the column position insider square brackets. (e.g. df[, -2] excludes the second column of dataframe df)\n\nknn_model1 &lt;- knn(train = training_data[, -1],\n                  test = test_data[, -1],\n                  cl = training_data$Private,\n                  k = 1)\n\nknn_model9 &lt;- knn(train = training_data[, -1],\n                  test = test_data[, -1],\n                  cl = training_data$Private,\n                  k = 9)\n\nWe are trying to predict Private Yes/No. knn() output predicted values for our test data, so we can compare actual v. predicted values. “prediction == actual” gives a vector with the same number of elements as there are observations in the test set. Each element will either be TRUE (the prediction was correct) or FALSE (the prediction was wrong). Applying which() to this vector will yield the index numbers for all the elements equal to TRUE. Applying length() to that vector tells us how many are TRUE (e.g. for how many observations prediction == actual). We can then divide by the number of observations in the test data to obtain the accuracy rate\n\naccuracy1  &lt;- length(which(knn_model1 == test_data$Private)) / nrow(test_data)\naccuracy9 &lt;- length(which(knn_model9 == test_data$Private)) / nrow(test_data)\n\nprint(accuracy1)\n\n[1] 0.9096774\n\nprint(accuracy9)\n\n[1] 0.9225806\n\n\nLet’s visualize what is happening in a KNN classification model. We will use the ggplot2 package to create a scatterplot of the training data, and then overlay the test data on top of it. We will color the points by whether the school is private or not.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = training_data, \n       aes(x = Outstate, y = F.Undergrad, \n           color = as.factor(Private))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(data = test_data, aes(x = Outstate, y = F.Undergrad), \n             color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"blue\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Private\")) \n\n\n\n\nThis seems like excellent predictive performance. However, it’s good to think about the distribution of the data. As an extreme example, if all schools in the data were private, we would expect 100% prediction accuracy regardless of our model. Let’s see how well we do if our prediction is all schools are Private. Start by calculating the proportion of private schools\n\nprint(length(which(test_data$Private == \"Yes\")) / nrow(test_data))\n\n[1] 0.716129\n\n\nWe can also check our accuracy on Private schools v. Public schools. To do this, we need to figure out which schools are private in the test data. Specifically, get the indices for the private schools\n\nprivate_schools &lt;- which(test_data$Private == \"Yes\")\npublic_schools &lt;- which(test_data$Private == \"No\")\n\nprint(private_schools)\n\n  [1]   1   2   3   8  11  12  13  14  15  16  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  27\n [19]  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  37  38  39  41  42  43  44  45  47  48\n [37]  49  50  51  52  53  55  56  57  58  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  68  69\n [55]  76  77  78  80  81  82  84  85  86  90  91  92  93  94  96  97  99 100\n [73] 101 102 104 106 107 108 110 112 113 116 119 120 121 122 123 125 127 128\n [91] 129 130 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 142 145 146 147 148 149 151 152\n[109] 153 154 155\n\nprint(public_schools)\n\n [1]   4   5   6   7   9  10  17  25  26  36  40  46  54  59  67  70  71  72  73\n[20]  74  75  79  83  87  88  89  95  98 103 105 109 111 114 115 117 118 124 126\n[39] 131 132 141 143 144 150\n\n\nTo calculate the prediction accuracy for private schools, we need to know how many (true not predicted) private schools are in the test data. Likewise, we need to know how many public schools are in the test data.\n\nnum_private_schools &lt;- length(private_schools)\nnum_public_schools &lt;- length(public_schools)\n\nNow we will calculate the prediction accuracy separately for private and public schools.\n\nprivate_accuracy1 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model1[private_schools] == test_data$Private[private_schools])) /\n  num_private_schools\n\nprivate_accuracy9 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model9[private_schools] == test_data$Private[private_schools])) /\n  num_private_schools\n\nNow we will calculate the prediction accuracy separately for private and public schools.\n\n## Private schools (% correctly predicted):\nprivate_accuracy1 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model1[private_schools] == test_data$Private[private_schools])) /\n  num_private_schools\n\nprivate_accuracy9 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model9[private_schools] == test_data$Private[private_schools])) /\n  num_private_schools\n\n\n# Public schools (% correctly predicted): \npublic_accuracy1 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model1[public_schools] == test_data$Private[public_schools])) /\n  num_public_schools\n\npublic_accuracy9 &lt;- length(\n  which(knn_model9[public_schools] == test_data$Private[public_schools])) /\n  num_public_schools\n\nLet’s see how it did on different school types:\n\nprint(private_accuracy1)\n\n[1] 0.9459459\n\nprint(public_accuracy1)\n\n[1] 0.8181818\n\nprint(private_accuracy9)\n\n[1] 0.972973\n\nprint(public_accuracy9)\n\n[1] 0.7954545\n\n\nTherefore, we did better on private schools than public schools because our prediction accuracy was higher on private schools. Thinking about differential performance by label is related to fairness of machine learning algorithms.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note that the material in these notes draws on the excellent past notes by TFs Laura Morris, Emily Mower and more thorough treatment of these topics in by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.\n\n\nIn this class, we will see a series of methods that fall under the support vector umbrella but which vary significantly in their flexibility. We start with maximal margin classifiers, which are the most rigid and only work when the data can be perfectly separated with a linear decision boundary. Then, we will cover support vector classifiers, which still uses a linear decision boundary, but which can accommodate data that cannot be perfectly separated by such a decision boundary. We will then cover support vector machines, which flexibly transform the original data to allow for decision boundaries that are non-linear in the original feature space (though they remain linear in the transformed feature space). Like support vector classifiers, support vector machines will also accommodate data that is not perfectly separable. Finally, we will touch upon extending the support vector ideas to multiclass settings.\n\n\n\nMaximal margin classifiers use a separating hyperplane to divide the feature space in two, with the idea being that all observations in one class lie on one side of the separating hyperplane while all observations of the other class lie on the other side.\n\n\n\nA hyperplane is a flat affine subspace that has one fewer dimensions than the feature space. The first part of the definition (“flat affine subspace”) means that the subspace can be described by a linear equation and does not need to pass through the origin. The second part of the definition (about the dimensionality) means that with \\(p\\) features, the hyperplane will have \\(p-1\\) dimensions. When we say “separating hyperplane,” we mean a hyperplane that separates the observations in one class from observations in the other by slicing the feature space in two.\nImagine a dataset with only two features, \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\). The feature space is a plane, which can be divided by a line (which is a hyperplane). Suppose you had three features, \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), and \\(X_3\\). The feature space is 3D and can be divided in two by a plane (which is also a hyperplane). We can continue to generalize to higher dimensional feature spaces.\nThe separating hyperplane that divides the feature space with \\(p\\) features can be described by a linear function of the following form\n\\[\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_p x_p = 0\n\\]\n\n\nWe can then use this equation as our classifier. Specifically, let \\(f(x)\\) represent the left hand side of the previous equation. To identify the class for observation \\(x^\\star\\), you first calculate \\(f(x^\\star)\\)\n\\[\nf(x^*) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1^* + \\beta_2 x_2^* + ... + \\beta_p x_p^*\n\\]\nIf the resulting value is negative, the point lies to one side of the hyperplane and is assigned to class \\(y=-1\\). If it’s positive, the point lies on the other side of the hyperplane and is assigned to class \\(y=+1\\). If the point is far from the separating hyperplane, we are quite confident in our classification. If it’s close, we have much more uncertainty. In this sense, the sign of \\(f(x^\\star)\\) gives us the class and the magnitude of \\(f(x^\\star)\\) gives us our level of confidence. Given the linear form of the separating hyperplane, the decision boundary will also be linear.\nNote that we are now using \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\) for our binary classes, whereas up to this point we have used \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n\n\nThe maximal margin classifier can be used when the data is perfectly separable, meaning that there exists a separating hyperplane such that all observations from one class fall on one side of the hyperplane and all observations from the other class fall on the other side of the hyperplane. However, when one such separating hyperplane exists, usually infinite such separating hyperplanes exist. The maximal margin classifier provides a disciplined way to choose among them.\nSpecifically, it measures the distance between each point and the separating hyperplane. The minimum distance between all points and the separating hyperplane is referred to as the margin. The maximal margin classifier selects that separating hyperplane that leads to the largest possible margin, that is, the largest possible distance between the separating hyperplane and the closest training points. Note that as you increase the distance between the decision boundary and the closest point from one class, you must decrease the distance between the decision boundary and the closest point(s) from the other class. Therefore, the margin will always be defined by at least one point from each class. These points are called ``support’’ points or vectors and the model is fully defined by them, so if they move the model changes. Other points can move however they like outside the margins, and as long as they do not cross the margins, the model will not change.\nWhen the margin is large, it suggests the classes are very well separated and performance on a test set should be good. When the margin is small, the classes are only barely separated and the exact decision boundary may not do as well in the test set.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes the data cannot be perfectly separated by a separating hyperplane. In such cases, the support vector classifier offers a generalization of the maximal margin classifier.\nThe support vector classifier is extremely similar to the maximal margin classifier, except that it allows some points to cross the margin and even the decision boundary (e.g. be misclassified). Because some points can cross the margin under the support vector classifier, we call the margin a “soft margin” compared to the “hard margin” of the maximal margin classifier, which does not permit any points to cross it.\nThe support vector classifier improves empirically relative to the maximal margin classifier in three key ways. One, it works for data that cannot be perfectly separated by a hyperplane. Two, it is more robust to individual points, meaning that because it allows points to cross the margin, movement in points near the margin will not have the same dramatic impact on the margin and decision boundary that they would have had under the maximal margin classifier. Third, related to this point, the support vector classifier yields better predictions for most training observations.\nThe support vector classifier works by creating slack variables \\(\\epsilon_i\\) and allowing a misclassification “budget” \\(C\\). The slack variables \\(\\epsilon_i\\) will be zero for all observations that fall on the correct side of the margin. If the observation is on the wrong side of the margin, \\(\\epsilon_i &gt; 0\\) and if it is on the wrong side of the hyperplane, \\(\\epsilon_i &gt; 1\\). The sum of the \\(\\epsilon_i\\)s must be no greater than the budget \\(C\\), so when the budget \\(C=0\\), no observations will be allowed on the wrong side of the margin. In this way, the maximal margin classifier is a special case of the support vector classifier. More generally, no more than \\(C\\) observations can be misclassified, because \\(\\epsilon_i&gt;1\\) when the observation is misclassified and \\(C\\) is the sum of the \\(\\epsilon_i\\)’s.\nThe budget \\(C\\) can be seen as a tuning parameter and is thus generally found through cross-validation. As \\(C\\) goes to zero, the classifier converges to the maximal margin classifier, so it is less tolerant of violations across the margin and thus the margins will shrink. As \\(C\\) gets large, it will become more tolerant of violations and the margin will increase.\nIn the support vector classifier, only observations that lie on the margin or that violate the margin will affect the hyperplane. Just as with the maximal margin classifier, points that lie on the correct side of the margin will not be used to define the hyperplane. As \\(C\\) increases, there are more violations and so more support vectors compared to when \\(C\\) is small. Given that there are more support vectors used when \\(C\\) is large, large \\(C\\) leads to lower variance though higher bias compared to small \\(C\\) (which uses a small number of support vectors). Intuitively, this is because the model is not as sensitive to the exact training points since more of them are used in defining the hyperplane when \\(C\\) is large.\n\n\n\nThe support vector machine extends the support vector classifier to the case where the decision boundary is non-linear. It is somewhat analogous to using polynomial regression when the linearity assumption of linear regression does not hold. Specifically, it works with a transformed feature space and finds a decision boundary that is linear in the transformed space, but which is non-linear in the original space.\nHowever, the way in which the support vector machine transforms the original space is new. It does the transformation using a kernel \\(K(x_i, x_{i^\\prime})\\), which is a generalization of the inner product \\(&lt;x_i,x_{i^\\prime}&gt;\\) (e.g. dot product). The hyperplane is then defined by\n\\[\n    f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{S}}\\alpha_i K(x,x_i)\n\\]\nThe values of \\(\\alpha_i\\) are only non-zero for support vectors (points that lie on or across the margin). Some popular kernels include the polynomial kernel and the radial kernel. Note that the support vector classifier is a special case of the support vector machine where the kernel is a polynomial kernel of degree \\(d=1\\). Just like the support vector classifier, it maintains the principle of a budget \\(C\\), though now we use \\(\\alpha_i\\) instead of \\(\\epsilon_i\\).\nThe argument for why we use a kernel rather than an enlarged feature space has to do with computational efficiency. Using the kernel only requires computing the kernel (the generalized inner product) for each unique pair $(x_i, x_{i^}) $ in the training data; it does not require explicitly working in a transformed feature space, which may be computationally intractable. For example, suppose we wanted to expand our feature space from \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) to also include \\(x_3 = x_1^2 + x_2^2\\). Instead of explicitly calculating \\(x_3\\), we only need to adjust the inner product between two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from\n\\[\nK(a,b) = x_{1,a}x_{1,b}+x_{2,a}x_{2,b}\n\\]\nto\n\\[\nK(a,b) = x_{1,a}x_{1,b}+x_{2,a}x_{2,b} +\n    (x_{1,a}^2 + x_{1,b}^2)(x_{2,a}^2 + x_{2,b}^2)\n\\]\nThe kernel function can take many forms, including polynomial and radial functions. Different kernel functions allow for different levels of model flexibility. However, note that as with many other models we’ve seen this semester, the more flexible we make the kernel, the more likely we are to fit the training data well (low bias) but risk overfitting the training data (high variance). Therefore, in the support vector machine, a very flexible kernel function leads to low bias but high variance.\n\n\n\nThe idea of support vector machines does not generalize easily to the multiclass setting, but two options have been proposed.\nOne is called the one-versus-one approach, where a collection of models is built that each evaluate the question of whether the observation belongs to class \\(a\\) or class \\(b\\). This is repeated with all possible pairs of classes in the data. For a given test point, you tally how many times the observation is assigned to each of the \\(K\\) classes and assign whichever class was assigned most often.\nThe other is called the one-versus-all approach, where \\(K\\) models are built and each model compares the class at hand to a collection of the other \\(K-1\\) classes, coded collectively as -1. For a given test point, you determine which \\(f_k(x)\\) is largest (most confidence) and assign that class."

    "section": "Tree-Based Methods",
    "text": "Tree-Based Methods\nTree-based methods are non-parametric supervised learning methods that stratify or segment the predictor space into a number of simple regions. They can be used for both regression and clas- sification. After building a tree using the training data, a prediction can be made by using the training observations in the region to which the new observation belongs. For a regression tree, the predicted response for an observation is given by the mean response of the training observations that belong to the same terminal node. In contrast, for a classification tree, we predict that each observation belongs to the most commonly occurring class of training observations in the region to which it belongs. Decision trees are simple and useful for interpretation. However, they typically have lower predictive power than other supervised learning methods. Bagging, random forests, and boosting are approaches to improve decision trees by involving multiple trees, which are then combined to yield a single consensus prediction. These approaches can dramatically improve the prediction accuracy of decision trees, at the expense of interpretability.\n\nDecision Trees\nTo interpret a decision tree, suppose we have below tree from the Hitters data. The Figure represents a regression tree for predicting the log salary of a baseball player, based on the two predictors—the number of years that he has played in the major leagues and the number of hits that he made in the previous year. We can read the tree sequentially from top to bottom. At a given node (where the branches split), the label (of the form \\(X_j &lt; t_k\\)) indicates the left-hand branch emanating from that split, and the right-hand branch corresponds to \\(X_j \\geq t_k\\). For instance, the split at the top of the tree results in two large branches. The left-hand branch corresponds to \\(Years &lt; 4.5\\) and the right-hand branch corresponds to \\(Years \\geq 4.5\\). The number in each leaf (terminal nodes) is the mean of the response (outcomes) for the observations (in the training data) that fall there.\n\n\n\nDecision Tree Example\n\n\nDecision trees are easier to interpret and have a nice graphical representation. Unfortunately, fitting a decision tree is not simple. It is computationally infeasible to consider every possible partition of the feature space into \\(J\\) boxes. For this reason, we take a top-down, greedy approach that is known as recursive binary splitting. The approach is top-down because it begins at the top of the tree (at which point all observations belong to a single region) and then successively splits the predictor space; each split is indicated via two new branches further down on the tree. It is greedy because, at each step of the tree-building process, the best split is made at that particular step, rather than looking ahead and picking a split that will lead to a better tree in some future step. In order to perform recursive binary splitting, we first select the predictor \\(X_j\\) and the cutpoint \\(s\\) such that splitting the predictor space into the regions \\(\\{X|X_j &lt; s\\}\\) and \\(\\{X|X_j \\geq s\\}\\) leads to the greatest possible reduction in RSS. For building a classification tree, alternatives to RSS are the classification error rate, Gini index, and entropy. Instead of the error rate, either the Gini index or the entropy are typically used to evaluate the quality of a particular split, since these two approaches are more sensitive to node purity than is the classification error rate.\nAnother problem with the decision tree is that the process described above may produce good predictions on the training set but is likely to overfit the data, leading to poor test set performance. A better strategy is to grow a very large tree and then prune it back in order to obtain a subtree. We can use the cross validation to prune the tree.\nThe advantages of trees are the following: (1) trees are very easy to explain; (2) trees can be displayed graphically and are easily interpreted even by a non-expert; (3) trees can easily handle qualitative predictors without the need to create dummy variables. Disadvantages of trees are the following: (1) trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other regression and classification approaches; (2) trees can be very non-robust, i.e., a small change in the data can cause a large change in the final estimated tree.\n\n\nBagging\nBagging, random forests, and boosting are approaches to improve decision trees by involving multiple trees, which are then combined to yield a single consensus prediction. To apply bagging to regression trees, we simply construct \\(B\\) regression trees using \\(B\\) bootstrapped training sets and average the resulting predictions. These trees are grown deep and are not pruned. Because the tree is not pruned, it means each tree is more flexible, hence high variance but low bias. Averaging these \\(B\\) trees reduces the variance because in statistics, averaging a set of observations reduces variance. For bagging classification trees, we can record the class predicted by each of the \\(B\\) trees, and take a majority vote (i.e., the most commonly occurring class among the \\(B\\) predictions).\nWe can also obtain an overall summary of the importance of each predictor using the RSS (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging regression trees, we can record the total amount that the RSS is decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all \\(B\\) trees. A large value indicates an important predictor.\n\n\nRandom forests\nThe main difference between bagging and random forests is the choice of predictor subset size m. When building decision trees in random forests, each time a split in a tree is considered, a random sample of m predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of p predictors. If a random forest is built using \\(m = p\\), then this amounts simply to bagging. Random forests can provide an improvement over bagged trees by decorrelating the trees, i.e., forcing the tree to consider different splits and thus avoid the situation when all trees to have similar structures due to a small subset of strong predictors. In general, using a small value of m in building a random forest will typically be helpful when we have a large number of correlated predictors.\n\n\nBoosting\nIn boosting, each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees. Boosting does not involve bootstrap sampling, but instead, each tree is fit on a modified version of the original data set. Unlike in bagging, the construction of each tree depends strongly on the trees that have already been grown. Boosting involves the parameters that we have to determine. The shrinkage parameter \\(\\lambda\\), a small positive number, controls the rate at which boosting learns. Very small \\(\\lambda\\) can require using a very large value of B and thus achieve good performance. We also need to determine the number \\(d\\) of splits in each tree, which controls the complexity of the boosted ensemble. Similar to \\(\\lambda\\), a small \\(d\\) can typically achieve a slower learn, which means better performance."

If yes, it’s parametric. When thinking about if a problem is a classification problem or a regression problem, it is helpful to think about the outcome in the training data. If the outcome is continuous, then it’s a regression problem. If the outcome is categorical, it’s a classification problem. The emphasis on the outcome in the training data is to avoid the confusion that arises when you look at prediction output.

It assumes knowledge of the true underlying distribution of the data, which you will not have in practice. Given features \\(X\\), it knows the true probability that \\(Y\\) belongs to each possible class. It predicts the most likely class, which is the best decision rule given the available features.\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) approximates the Bayes’ Classifier, given the information available and the assumption that features are Normally (Gaussian) distributed within each class. The result is decision boundaries that are linear in the included features.\nWhen there is one feature (predictor), LDA estimates class-specific means \\(\\hat{\\mu}_k\\) and a single variance \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) that is common to all classes. When there are multiple features, LDA estimates class-specific mean vectors \\(\\hat{\\mu}_k\\) and a single variance-covariance matrix \\(\\hat{\\Sigma}\\) that is assumed to be relevant to all classes. In both cases (one feature or many features), LDA also calculates the unconditional probability of belonging to each class \\(\\hat{\\pi}_k\\). LDA then takes these components (means, variance, and unconditional class probability) and calculates a discriminant function for each observation and each class. For each observation, the predicted class is determined by the largest discriminant.\nQuadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) is conceptually similar, though instead of requiring all classes to share the same variance or variance-covariance matrix, it allows for class-specific variances. This has the effect of allowing non-linear decision boundaries. The drawback, though, is that allowing for class-specific variances (and especially class-specific variance-covariance matrices) increases the number of parameters to estimate, increasing the likelihood of overfitting."

For example, binary variables will never be normally distributed nor well approximated by a normal distribution, and so the methods are not appropriate to use in the presence of binary features.\nQDA differs from LDA by assuming the variance or variance-covariance matrix of the feature(s) varies from class to class.

    "text": "Logistic regression\nNow, let’s say we are interested in using a logistic regression. For a base case, let’s try to predict default from the other available variables using logistic regression. To run logistic regression in R, use glm(), which requires three arguments: - 1st: Your formula (y ~ x1 + x2) - 2nd: Family = binomial tells it to use logistic regression - 3rd: You data, including both x and y columns.\nWe will train the model on the training data, make predictions for the test data using predict(), and measure performance with Accuracy.\n\nlogistic_default &lt;- glm(default ~ student + balance + income,\n                        family = binomial,\n                        data = train_data)\n\nTo view information about the logistic regression, including coefficients, use summary()\n\nsummary(logistic_default)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = default ~ student + balance + income, family = binomial, \n    data = train_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

We will use the head() function, which prints the first few values of the object inside the parentheses. If you want to change the number of observations that are printed to 100, you can use head(object, n = 100)\n\nhead(logistic_predict)\n\n        4350           18         6678         4788         9481         9994 \n5.133197e-04 2.176129e-04 2.515555e-03 3.317590e-02 2.508148e-05 4.935658e-03 \n\n\nWe see that the prediction outputs are probabilities, so in order to make predictions we have to decide on a decision rule. A common one is if the predicted probability is &gt; 0.5, predict 1 otherwise 0. Let’s see how we would do using this rule. Because it’s a classification problem, accuracy is a good measure (% correct)\n\nclass_predictions &lt;- as.numeric(logistic_predict &gt; 0.5)\nlogistic_accuracy &lt;- mean(class_predictions == test_data$default)\nprint(logistic_accuracy)\n\n[1] 0.9745\n\n\n\nsummary(test_data$default)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

For example, we may not want to give loans to people who will default even if this means denying loans to some people who wouldn’t default. We can measure error rate by true default status. Note that for defaulters, default = 1. Here, I pull out all the predictions for the true defaulters and see what fraction of those equal 1.\n\ntrue_pos_accuracy &lt;- mean(class_predictions[which(test_data$default == 1)] == 1)\nprint(true_pos_accuracy)\n\n[1] 0.3333333\n\n\nLike-wise for the non-defaulters, I see what fraction of those equal 0. This gives class-specific accuracy rates.\n\ntrue_neg_accuracy &lt;- mean(\n  class_predictions[which(test_data$default == 0)] == 0)\nprint(true_neg_accuracy)\n\n[1] 0.9974107\n\n\nThese values summarise what can also be seen in the following table. Where the columns correspond to the true values and the rows correspond to the predicted values.\n\ntable(class_predictions, test_data$default)\n\n                 \nclass_predictions    0    1\n                0 1926   46\n                1    5   23\n\n\nSuppose instead of the accuracy, you wanted to directly calculate the error rate. How would you do it? Hint, errors are ones where the prediction does not equal the true value. In R, we use != for “does not equal”\nWe can also calculate the error rate for the true defaulters and non-defaulters.\n\ntrue_pos_error &lt;- mean(class_predictions\n                       [which(test_data$default == 1)] != 1)\nprint(true_pos_error)\n\n[1] 0.6666667\n\ntrue_neg_error &lt;- mean(class_predictions\n                       [which(test_data$default == 0)] != 0)\nprint(true_neg_error)\n\n[1] 0.002589332\n\n\nWe see that we did a lot better on the true negatives than the true positives. Among all the people who will default, we only predicted about 1/3% of them would default. If we want to do a better job identifying these people, we can do this by lowering the default threshold from a predicted probability of 0.5 to something lower, say 0.2. Note, though, that lowering this threshold means increasing the number of default predictions for people who don’t default as well. Since we aren’t really sure how low we want to make this threshold, we can try for a bunch of threshold values and then see how the performance changes to pick the one that is best for our setting. This involves domain knowledge, such as the cost of default and the earnings on loans extended to people who repay, so there’s not one right answer, but we can more clearly see the tradeoffs by trying many values and plotting the error rates in each group as a function of the threshold.\nTo do this, we can use a loop to try a bunch of threshold values and then calculate the error rates for each threshold. We can then plot the error rates as a function of the threshold to see how the error rates change as we change the threshold.\n\n## First, we need to specify the list of threshold values to assess\nthreshold_values &lt;- seq(from = 0.00, to = 0.50, by = 0.01)\nthreshold_values\n\n [1] 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14\n[16] 0.15 0.16 0.17 0.18 0.19 0.20 0.21 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.25 0.26 0.27 0.28 0.29\n[31] 0.30 0.31 0.32 0.33 0.34 0.35 0.36 0.37 0.38 0.39 0.40 0.41 0.42 0.43 0.44\n[46] 0.45 0.46 0.47 0.48 0.49 0.50\n\n\nThen we initialize a matrix of error rates. This matrix will have a number of rows corresponding to the length of the list of threshold values and 2 columns corresponding to the true positive and true negative accuracy for each value that we test\n\nerror_rates &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = length(threshold_values), ncol = 2)\n\nNow we can start the loop. We initialize a tracker for the row index, then for each threshold value in our specified list of values, we update the tracker to reflect the row, generate the predicted classes using the specific threshold, calculate the true positive accuracy, calculate the true negative accuracy, and add the results to our matrix.\n\nindx &lt;- 0\n\nfor(threshold in threshold_values) {\n  \n  ## Update the tracker to reflect the row\n  indx &lt;- indx + 1\n  \n  ## Then generate the predicted classes using the specific threshold\n  class_predictions &lt;- as.numeric(logistic_predict &gt; threshold)\n  \n  ## Then calculate the true positive accuracy\n  true_pos_accuracy &lt;- mean(class_predictions[which(test_data$default == 1)] == 1)\n  \n  ## Then calculate the true negative accuracy\n  true_neg_accuracy &lt;- mean(class_predictions[which(test_data$default == 0)] == 0)\n  \n  ## Now we can add the results to our matrix \n  error_rates[indx,] &lt;- c(true_pos_accuracy, true_neg_accuracy)\n}\n\nLet’s plot each of these as a function of the threshold\n\nmatplot(x = threshold_values,\n        y = error_rates, \n        type = \"l\",\n        col = 3:4,\n        xlab = \"Threshold\",\n        ylab = \"Accuracy\",\n        main = \"Accuracy as a Function of Threshold\")\n        legend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Defaulters\", \"Non-defaulters\"), \n               col = 3:4, pch = 1)"

In this review session, we consider two popular types of resampling methods: Cross-validation and Bootstrap.\n\n\nCross-validation is a method that works by holding out a subset of the training observations from the model fitting process, and then applying the model to those held out observations.\n\n\nThis is the type of cross-validation method we have been using in review sessions so far. It involves randomly dividing the available set of observations into two parts, a training set and a validation set. The model is fit on the training set, and the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in the validation set. The validation error rate provides an estimate of the test error rate.\nThe validation set approach is simple and is easy to implement, but it has a few drawbacks. First, it can yield estimates of the test error rate that are highly variable. In addition, since it trains the model using only a subset of the data, it may tend to overestimate the test error rate for the model fit on the entire data set.\n\n\n\nLeave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) attempts to address the drawbacks of the validation set method. Instead of creating two subsets, a single observation is used for the validation set, and the remaining (\\(n - 1\\)) observations constitute the training set. The statistical learning method is fit on the \\(n - 1\\) training observations, and a prediction is made for the excluded observation to estimate a test error rate. The procedure is repeated \\(n\\) times, by selecting each individual observation for the validation data, training the procedure on the \\(n - 1\\) observations, and computing the test error. The LOOCV estimate for the test error is the average of these \\(n\\) test error estimates.\nCompared to the validation set approach, LOOCV is more expensive to implement. However, it has less bias since it uses almost all the training observations and yields estimates of the test error rate that are less variable through its averaging feature.\n\n\n\n\\(k\\)-fold Cross-validation is an alternative to LOOCV. For \\(j=1,...,k\\), the model is fit on all folds except fold \\(j\\). Then, the model’s predictive performance on the data is assessed in fold \\(j\\). Thus, for a given iteration, the “training” data is data from all the folds except for fold \\(j\\), and the ``test’’ data is data from fold \\(j\\). This process is repeated for \\(j=1,...,k\\) and a test error is estimated for each fold. The \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation estimate for the test error is the average of these \\(k\\) test error estimates.\nLOOCV can be thought of as a special type \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation, where \\(k\\) equals the number of observations in the data. In practice, one typically performs \\(k\\)-fold CV using \\(k = 5\\) or \\(k = 10\\), which provides computational advantage over \\(k = n\\). Beyond computational issues, LOOCV has lower bias but higher variance (why?), compared to \\(k\\)-fold CV with \\(k &lt; n\\). Overall, \\(k\\)-fold CV tends to win in terms of the bias-variance trade-off.\n\n\n\n\nBootstrapping involves resampling a data set with replacement. It is a very useful statistical tool that allows one to quantify the uncertainty of an estimator, such as a coefficient. This is especially useful for models where there is not a convenient standard error formula. When the goal is to estimate the uncertainty of an estimate, one can bootstrap the data and generate the estimate many times (e.g. 1,000 times). Then, one can look at the distribution of the estimates and take the middle 95% as the 95% confidence interval.\nBootstrapping is also an important component of some very powerful machine learning models. We will learn about some of these models in the next few weeks."

It is stored in R environment as an object with this name.\nArguments: An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.\nFunction Body: The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does.\nReturn Value: The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.\n\n\n## Example of a simple function\nadd_fun &lt;- function(a1, a2){\n  res = a1 + a2\n  return(res)\n}\n\nadd_fun(3, 4)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\n\n\nFunction to perform cross-validation\nLet’s write a function to do cross-validation.

    "title": "Section 6 - Regularization and Dimension Reduction",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note that the material in these notes draws on past TF’s notes (Ibou Dieye, Laura Morris, Emily Mower, Amy Wickett), and the more thorough treatment of these topics in Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.\nThe goal of this session is to review concepts related to regularization methods (LASSO and Ridge Regression) and dimension reduction techniques (PCA and PLS).\n\n\n\n\nLeast Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Ridge Regression both fall under a broader class of models called shrinkage models. Shrinkage models regularize or penalize coefficient estimates, which means that they shrink the coefficients toward zero. Shrinking the coefficient estimates can reduce their variance, so these methods are particularly useful for models where we are concerned about high variance (i.e. over-fitting), such as models with a large number of predictors relative to the number of observations.\nBoth LASSO and Ridge regression operate by adding a penalty to the normal OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) minimization problem. These penalties can be thought of as a budget, and sometimes the minimization problem is explicitly formulated as minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) subject to a budget constraint. The idea of the budget is if you have a small budget, you can only afford a little “total” \\(\\beta\\), where the definition of “total” \\(\\beta\\) varies between LASSO and Ridge, but as your budget increases, you get closer and closer to the OLS \\(\\beta\\)s.\nLASSO and Ridge regression differ in exactly how they penalize the coefficients. In particular, LASSO penalizes the coefficients using an \\(L_1\\) penalty:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\n    y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j x_{ij}\n    \\right)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j| = RSS + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\n\\]\nRidge regression penalizes the coefficients using an \\(L_2\\) penalty:\n\\[\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\n    y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j x_{ij}\n    \\right)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2 = RSS + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2\n\\] You may notice that both the LASSO and Ridge Regression minimization problems feature a parameter \\(\\lambda\\). This is a tuning parameter that dictates how much we will penalize the “total” coefficients. Tuning parameters appear in many models and get their name from the fact that we tune (adjust / choose) them in order to improve our model’s performance.\nSince LASSO and Ridge Regression are used when we are concerned about variance (over-fitting), it should come as no surprise that increasing \\(\\lambda\\) decreases variance. It can be helpful to contextualize the \\(\\lambda\\) size by realizing that \\(\\lambda=0\\) is OLS and \\(\\lambda =\\infty\\) results in only \\(\\beta_0\\) being assigned a non-zero value.\nAs we increase \\(\\lambda\\) from zero, we decrease variance but increase bias (the classic bias-variance tradeoff). To determine the best \\(\\lambda\\) (e.g. the \\(\\lambda\\) that will lead to the best out of sample predictive performance), it is common to use cross validation. A good function in R that trains LASSO and Ridge Regression models and uses cross-validation to select a good \\(\\lambda\\) is cv.glmnet(), which is part of the glmnet package.\n\n\n\nAs noted above, both LASSO and Ridge regression shrink the coefficients toward zero. However, the penalty in Ridge (\\(\\lambda \\beta_j^2\\)) will not set any of coefficients exactly to zero (unless \\(\\lambda =\\infty\\)). Increasing the value of \\(\\lambda\\) will tend to reduce the magnitudes of the coefficients (which helps reduce variance), but will not result in exclusion of any of the variables. While this may not impact prediction accuracy, it can create a challenge in model interpretation in settings where the number of features is large. This is an obvious disadvantage.\nOn the other hand, the \\(L_1\\) penalty of LASSO forces some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly equal to zero when the tuning parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is sufficiently large. Therefore, LASSO performs variable selection, much like best subset selection.\n\n\n\nLASSO and Ridge Regression are useful models to use when dealing with a large number of predictors \\(p\\) relative to the number of observations \\(n\\). It is good to standardize your features so that coefficients are not selected because of their scale rather than their relative importance.\nFor example, suppose you were predicting salary, and suppose you had a standardized test score that was highly predictive of salary and you also had parents’ income, which was only somewhat predictive of salary. Since standardized test scores are measured on a much smaller scale than the outcome and than parents’ income, we would expect the coefficient on test scores to be large relative to the coefficient on parents’ income. This means it would likely be shrunk by adding the penalty, even though it reflects a strong predictive relationship.\n\n\n\nCoefficients produced by LASSO and Ridge Regression should not be interpreted causally. These methods are used for prediction, and as such, our focus is on \\(\\hat{y}\\). This is in contrast to an inference problem, where we would be interested in \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\).\nThe intuition behind why we cannot interpret the coefficients causally is similar to the intuition underlying Omitted Variables Bias (OVB). In OVB, we said that if two variables \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) were correlated with each other and with the outcome \\(Y\\), then the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) in a regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(X_1\\) would differ from the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) in a regression where \\(X_2\\) was also included. This is because since \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are correlated, when we omit \\(X_2\\), the coefficient on \\(X_1\\) picks up the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(Y\\) as well as some of the effect of \\(X_2\\) on \\(Y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal Components Analysis is a method of unsupervised learning. We have not yet covered unsupervised learning, though we will in the second half of the semester. The important thing to know at this point about unsupervised learning is that unsupervised learning methods do not use labels \\(Y\\).\nPrincipal Components Analysis (PCA), therefore, does not use \\(Y\\) in determining the principal components. Instead, the principal components are determined solely by looking at the predictors \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\). Each principal component is a weighted sum of the original predictors \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\). For clarity of notation, we will use \\(Z\\) to represent principal components and \\(X\\) to represent predictors.\nPrincipal components are created in an ordered way. The order can be described as follows: If you had to project all of the data onto only one line, the first principal component defines the line that would lead to points being as spread out as possible (e.g. having highest variance). If you had to project all of the data onto only one plane, the plane defined by the first two principal components (which are orthogonal by definition) would be the plane where the points were as spread out as possible (e.g. highest possible variance).\nSince variance is greatly affected by measurement scale, it is common practice and a good idea to scale your variables, so that results are not driven by the scale on which the variables were measured.\nWhen estimating principal components, you will estimate \\(p\\) components, where \\(p\\) is the number of predictors \\(X\\). However, you usually only pay attention to / use the first few components, since the last few components capture very little variance. Note that you can exactly recover your original data when using all \\(p\\) components.\n\n\n\nPrincipal Components Regression (PCR) regresses the outcome \\(Y\\) on the principal components \\(Z_1\\),…,\\(Z_M\\), where \\(M&lt;p\\) and \\(p\\) is the number of predictors \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\).\nNote that the principal components \\(Z_1\\),…,\\(Z_M\\) were defined by looking only at \\(X_1\\),…,\\(X_p\\) and not at \\(Y\\). Putting the principal components into a regression is the first time we are introducing any interaction between the principal components and the outcome \\(Y\\).\nThe main idea of Principal Components Regression is that hopefully only a few components explain most of the variance in the predictors overall and as is relevant to the relationship between the predictors and the response. In other words, when we use PCR, we assume that the directions in which \\(X\\) shows the most variance are also the directions most associated with \\(Y\\). When this assumption is true, we are able to use \\(M&lt;&lt;p\\) (e.g. \\(M\\) much smaller than \\(p\\)) parameters while still getting similar in-sample performance and hopefully better out-of-sample performance (due to not overfitting) to a regression of \\(Y\\) on all \\(p\\) predictors. Although the assumption is not guaranteed to be true, it is often a good enough approximation to give good results.\nPCA is one example of dimensionality reduction, because it reduces the dimension of the problem from \\(p\\) to \\(M\\). Note, though, that dimensionality reduction is different from feature selection. We are still using all features; we have just aggregated them into principal components.\nThe exact number \\(M\\) of principal components to use in PCR (the regression of \\(Y\\) on the principal components) is usually determined by cross-validation.\n\n\n\nWhen using PCR, there are a few things to pay attention to. First, be sure to standardize variables or else the first few principal components will favor features measured on larger scales. Second, the number of principal components to use in PCR is determined using cross-validation. If the number is high and close to the number of features in your data, the assumption that the directions in which the predictors vary most are also the directions that explain the relationship between the predictors and response is false. In such a case, other methods, such as ridge and lasso, are likely to perform better.\n\n\n\n\nPartial Least Squares is a supervised alternative to PCR. Recall that for PCR, the principal components \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\) were formed from the original features \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) without looking at \\(Y\\) (unsupervised).\nPartial Least Squares (PLS) also generates a new set of features \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\) but it uses the correlation between the predictors \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) and the outcome \\(Y\\) to determine the weights on \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) for each \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\). In this way, PLS attempts to find directions that explain both the response and the predictors.\nThe first feature \\(Z_1\\) is determined by weighting \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) proportional to each feature’s correlation with \\(Y\\). It then residualizes the predictors \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) by regressing them on \\(Z_1\\) and repeats the weighting procedure using the orthogonalized predictors. The process then repeats until we have \\(M\\) components, where \\(M\\) is determined by cross validation.\n\n\nJust as with PCR, it’s best practice to scale the predictors before running PLS.\n\n\n\nPLS directly uses \\(Y\\) in generating the features \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\). It then regresses \\(Y\\) on these features. Therefore, PLS uses \\(Y\\) twice in the process of estimating the model.\nIn contrast, PCR only looks at the outcome \\(Y\\) when estimating the final regression. The components are estimated without ``peeking’’ at \\(Y\\).\nBecause \\(Y\\) is used twice in PLS and only once in PCR, in practice PLS exhibits lower bias (e.g. is better able to fit the training data) but higher variance (e.g. is more sensitive to the exact training data). Therefore, the two methods generally have similar out-of-sample predictive power in practice."

    "text": "Partial Least Squares is a supervised alternative to PCR. Recall that for PCR, the principal components \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\) were formed from the original features \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) without looking at \\(Y\\) (unsupervised).\nPartial Least Squares (PLS) also generates a new set of features \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\) but it uses the correlation between the predictors \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) and the outcome \\(Y\\) to determine the weights on \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) for each \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\). In this way, PLS attempts to find directions that explain both the response and the predictors.\nThe first feature \\(Z_1\\) is determined by weighting \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) proportional to each feature’s correlation with \\(Y\\). It then residualizes the predictors \\(X_1,...,X_p\\) by regressing them on \\(Z_1\\) and repeats the weighting procedure using the orthogonalized predictors. The process then repeats until we have \\(M\\) components, where \\(M\\) is determined by cross validation.\n\n\nJust as with PCR, it’s best practice to scale the predictors before running PLS.\n\n\n\nPLS directly uses \\(Y\\) in generating the features \\(Z_1,...,Z_M\\). It then regresses \\(Y\\) on these features. Therefore, PLS uses \\(Y\\) twice in the process of estimating the model.\nIn contrast, PCR only looks at the outcome \\(Y\\) when estimating the final regression. The components are estimated without ``peeking’’ at \\(Y\\).\nBecause \\(Y\\) is used twice in PLS and only once in PCR, in practice PLS exhibits lower bias (e.g. is better able to fit the training data) but higher variance (e.g. is more sensitive to the exact training data). Therefore, the two methods generally have similar out-of-sample predictive power in practice."

    "text": "Note that more thorough treatment of these topics in Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.\n\n\nTree-based methods are non-parametric supervised learning methods that stratify or segment the predictor space into a number of simple regions. They can be used for both regression and clas- sification. After building a tree using the training data, a prediction can be made by using the training observations in the region to which the new observation belongs. For a regression tree, the predicted response for an observation is given by the mean response of the training observations that belong to the same terminal node. In contrast, for a classification tree, we predict that each observation belongs to the most commonly occurring class of training observations in the region to which it belongs. Decision trees are simple and useful for interpretation. However, they typically have lower predictive power than other supervised learning methods. Bagging, random forests, and boosting are approaches to improve decision trees by involving multiple trees, which are then combined to yield a single consensus prediction. These approaches can dramatically improve the prediction accuracy of decision trees, at the expense of interpretability.\n\n\nTo interpret a decision tree, suppose we have below tree from the Hitters data. The Figure represents a regression tree for predicting the log salary of a baseball player, based on the two predictors—the number of years that he has played in the major leagues and the number of hits that he made in the previous year. We can read the tree sequentially from top to bottom. At a given node (where the branches split), the label (of the form \\(X_j &lt; t_k\\)) indicates the left-hand branch emanating from that split, and the right-hand branch corresponds to \\(X_j \\geq t_k\\). For instance, the split at the top of the tree results in two large branches. The left-hand branch corresponds to \\(Years &lt; 4.5\\) and the right-hand branch corresponds to \\(Years \\geq 4.5\\). The number in each leaf (terminal nodes) is the mean of the response (outcomes) for the observations (in the training data) that fall there.\n\n\n\nDecision Tree Example\n\n\nDecision trees are easier to interpret and have a nice graphical representation. Unfortunately, fitting a decision tree is not simple. It is computationally infeasible to consider every possible partition of the feature space into \\(J\\) boxes. For this reason, we take a top-down, greedy approach that is known as recursive binary splitting. The approach is top-down because it begins at the top of the tree (at which point all observations belong to a single region) and then successively splits the predictor space; each split is indicated via two new branches further down on the tree. It is greedy because, at each step of the tree-building process, the best split is made at that particular step, rather than looking ahead and picking a split that will lead to a better tree in some future step. In order to perform recursive binary splitting, we first select the predictor \\(X_j\\) and the cutpoint \\(s\\) such that splitting the predictor space into the regions \\(\\{X|X_j &lt; s\\}\\) and \\(\\{X|X_j \\geq s\\}\\) leads to the greatest possible reduction in RSS. For building a classification tree, alternatives to RSS are the classification error rate, Gini index, and entropy. Instead of the error rate, either the Gini index or the entropy are typically used to evaluate the quality of a particular split, since these two approaches are more sensitive to node purity than is the classification error rate.\nAnother problem with the decision tree is that the process described above may produce good predictions on the training set but is likely to overfit the data, leading to poor test set performance. A better strategy is to grow a very large tree and then prune it back in order to obtain a subtree. We can use the cross validation to prune the tree.\nThe advantages of trees are the following: (1) trees are very easy to explain; (2) trees can be displayed graphically and are easily interpreted even by a non-expert; (3) trees can easily handle qualitative predictors without the need to create dummy variables. Disadvantages of trees are the following: (1) trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other regression and classification approaches; (2) trees can be very non-robust, i.e., a small change in the data can cause a large change in the final estimated tree.\n\n\n\nBagging, random forests, and boosting are approaches to improve decision trees by involving multiple trees, which are then combined to yield a single consensus prediction. To apply bagging to regression trees, we simply construct \\(B\\) regression trees using \\(B\\) bootstrapped training sets and average the resulting predictions. These trees are grown deep and are not pruned. Because the tree is not pruned, it means each tree is more flexible, hence high variance but low bias. Averaging these \\(B\\) trees reduces the variance because in statistics, averaging a set of observations reduces variance. For bagging classification trees, we can record the class predicted by each of the \\(B\\) trees, and take a majority vote (i.e., the most commonly occurring class among the \\(B\\) predictions).\nWe can also obtain an overall summary of the importance of each predictor using the RSS (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging regression trees, we can record the total amount that the RSS is decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all \\(B\\) trees. A large value indicates an important predictor.\n\n\n\nThe main difference between bagging and random forests is the choice of predictor subset size m. When building decision trees in random forests, each time a split in a tree is considered, a random sample of m predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of p predictors. If a random forest is built using \\(m = p\\), then this amounts simply to bagging. Random forests can provide an improvement over bagged trees by decorrelating the trees, i.e., forcing the tree to consider different splits and thus avoid the situation when all trees to have similar structures due to a small subset of strong predictors. In general, using a small value of m in building a random forest will typically be helpful when we have a large number of correlated predictors.\n\n\n\nIn boosting, each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees. Boosting does not involve bootstrap sampling, but instead, each tree is fit on a modified version of the original data set. Unlike in bagging, the construction of each tree depends strongly on the trees that have already been grown. Boosting involves the parameters that we have to determine. The shrinkage parameter \\(\\lambda\\), a small positive number, controls the rate at which boosting learns. Very small \\(\\lambda\\) can require using a very large value of B and thus achieve good performance. We also need to determine the number \\(d\\) of splits in each tree, which controls the complexity of the boosted ensemble. Similar to \\(\\lambda\\), a small \\(d\\) can typically achieve a slower learn, which means better performance."

Then, we will cover support vector classifiers, which still uses a linear decision boundary, but which can accommodate data that cannot be perfectly separated by such a decision boundary. We will then cover support vector machines, which flexibly transform the original data to allow for decision boundaries that are non-linear in the original feature space (though they remain linear in the transformed feature space). Like support vector classifiers, support vector machines will also accommodate data that is not perfectly separable. Finally, we will touch upon extending the support vector ideas to multiclass settings."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A hyperplane is a flat affine subspace that has one fewer dimensions than the feature space. The first part of the definition (“flat affine subspace”) means that the subspace can be described by a linear equation and does not need to pass through the origin. The second part of the definition (about the dimensionality) means that with \\(p\\) features, the hyperplane will have \\(p-1\\) dimensions. When we say “separating hyperplane,” we mean a hyperplane that separates the observations in one class from observations in the other by slicing the feature space in two.\nImagine a dataset with only two features, \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\). The feature space is a plane, which can be divided by a line (which is a hyperplane). Suppose you had three features, \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), and \\(X_3\\). The feature space is 3D and can be divided in two by a plane (which is also a hyperplane). We can continue to generalize to higher dimensional feature spaces.\nThe separating hyperplane that divides the feature space with \\(p\\) features can be described by a linear function of the following form\n\\[\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_p x_p = 0\n\\]\n\n\nWe can then use this equation as our classifier. Specifically, let \\(f(x)\\) represent the left hand side of the previous equation. To identify the class for observation \\(x^\\star\\), you first calculate \\(f(x^\\star)\\)\n\\[\nf(x^*) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1^* + \\beta_2 x_2^* + ... + \\beta_p x_p^*\n\\]\nIf the resulting value is negative, the point lies to one side of the hyperplane and is assigned to class \\(y=-1\\). If it’s positive, the point lies on the other side of the hyperplane and is assigned to class \\(y=+1\\). If the point is far from the separating hyperplane, we are quite confident in our classification. If it’s close, we have much more uncertainty. In this sense, the sign of \\(f(x^\\star)\\) gives us the class and the magnitude of \\(f(x^\\star)\\) gives us our level of confidence. Given the linear form of the separating hyperplane, the decision boundary will also be linear.\nNote that we are now using \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\) for our binary classes, whereas up to this point we have used \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n\n\nThe maximal margin classifier can be used when the data is perfectly separable, meaning that there exists a separating hyperplane such that all observations from one class fall on one side of the hyperplane and all observations from the other class fall on the other side of the hyperplane. However, when one such separating hyperplane exists, usually infinite such separating hyperplanes exist. The maximal margin classifier provides a disciplined way to choose among them.\nSpecifically, it measures the distance between each point and the separating hyperplane. The minimum distance between all points and the separating hyperplane is referred to as the margin. The maximal margin classifier selects that separating hyperplane that leads to the largest possible margin, that is, the largest possible distance between the separating hyperplane and the closest training points. Note that as you increase the distance between the decision boundary and the closest point from one class, you must decrease the distance between the decision boundary and the closest point(s) from the other class. Therefore, the margin will always be defined by at least one point from each class. These points are called ``support’’ points or vectors and the model is fully defined by them, so if they move the model changes. Other points can move however they like outside the margins, and as long as they do not cross the margins, the model will not change.\nWhen the margin is large, it suggests the classes are very well separated and performance on a test set should be good. When the margin is small, the classes are only barely separated and the exact decision boundary may not do as well in the test set."

In such cases, the support vector classifier offers a generalization of the maximal margin classifier.\nThe support vector classifier is extremely similar to the maximal margin classifier, except that it allows some points to cross the margin and even the decision boundary (e.g. be misclassified). Because some points can cross the margin under the support vector classifier, we call the margin a “soft margin” compared to the “hard margin” of the maximal margin classifier, which does not permit any points to cross it.\nThe support vector classifier improves empirically relative to the maximal margin classifier in three key ways. One, it works for data that cannot be perfectly separated by a hyperplane. Two, it is more robust to individual points, meaning that because it allows points to cross the margin, movement in points near the margin will not have the same dramatic impact on the margin and decision boundary that they would have had under the maximal margin classifier. Third, related to this point, the support vector classifier yields better predictions for most training observations.\nThe support vector classifier works by creating slack variables \\(\\epsilon_i\\) and allowing a misclassification “budget” \\(C\\). The slack variables \\(\\epsilon_i\\) will be zero for all observations that fall on the correct side of the margin. If the observation is on the wrong side of the margin, \\(\\epsilon_i &gt; 0\\) and if it is on the wrong side of the hyperplane, \\(\\epsilon_i &gt; 1\\). The sum of the \\(\\epsilon_i\\)s must be no greater than the budget \\(C\\), so when the budget \\(C=0\\), no observations will be allowed on the wrong side of the margin. In this way, the maximal margin classifier is a special case of the support vector classifier. More generally, no more than \\(C\\) observations can be misclassified, because \\(\\epsilon_i&gt;1\\) when the observation is misclassified and \\(C\\) is the sum of the \\(\\epsilon_i\\)’s.\nThe budget \\(C\\) can be seen as a tuning parameter and is thus generally found through cross-validation. As \\(C\\) goes to zero, the classifier converges to the maximal margin classifier, so it is less tolerant of violations across the margin and thus the margins will shrink. As \\(C\\) gets large, it will become more tolerant of violations and the margin will increase.\nIn the support vector classifier, only observations that lie on the margin or that violate the margin will affect the hyperplane. Just as with the maximal margin classifier, points that lie on the correct side of the margin will not be used to define the hyperplane. As \\(C\\) increases, there are more violations and so more support vectors compared to when \\(C\\) is small. Given that there are more support vectors used when \\(C\\) is large, large \\(C\\) leads to lower variance though higher bias compared to small \\(C\\) (which uses a small number of support vectors). Intuitively, this is because the model is not as sensitive to the exact training points since more of them are used in defining the hyperplane when \\(C\\) is large."

    "text": "The support vector machine extends the support vector classifier to the case where the decision boundary is non-linear. It is somewhat analogous to using polynomial regression when the linearity assumption of linear regression does not hold. Specifically, it works with a transformed feature space and finds a decision boundary that is linear in the transformed space, but which is non-linear in the original space.\nHowever, the way in which the support vector machine transforms the original space is new. It does the transformation using a kernel \\(K(x_i, x_{i^\\prime})\\), which is a generalization of the inner product \\(&lt;x_i,x_{i^\\prime}&gt;\\) (e.g. dot product). The hyperplane is then defined by\n\\[\n    f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{S}}\\alpha_i K(x,x_i)\n\\]\nThe values of \\(\\alpha_i\\) are only non-zero for support vectors (points that lie on or across the margin). Some popular kernels include the polynomial kernel and the radial kernel. Note that the support vector classifier is a special case of the support vector machine where the kernel is a polynomial kernel of degree \\(d=1\\). Just like the support vector classifier, it maintains the principle of a budget \\(C\\), though now we use \\(\\alpha_i\\) instead of \\(\\epsilon_i\\).\nThe argument for why we use a kernel rather than an enlarged feature space has to do with computational efficiency. Using the kernel only requires computing the kernel (the generalized inner product) for each unique pair $(x_i, x_{i^}) $ in the training data; it does not require explicitly working in a transformed feature space, which may be computationally intractable. For example, suppose we wanted to expand our feature space from \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) to also include \\(x_3 = x_1^2 + x_2^2\\). Instead of explicitly calculating \\(x_3\\), we only need to adjust the inner product between two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from\n\\[\nK(a,b) = x_{1,a}x_{1,b}+x_{2,a}x_{2,b}\n\\]\nto\n\\[\nK(a,b) = x_{1,a}x_{1,b}+x_{2,a}x_{2,b} +\n    (x_{1,a}^2 + x_{1,b}^2)(x_{2,a}^2 + x_{2,b}^2)\n\\]\nThe kernel function can take many forms, including polynomial and radial functions. Different kernel functions allow for different levels of model flexibility. However, note that as with many other models we’ve seen this semester, the more flexible we make the kernel, the more likely we are to fit the training data well (low bias) but risk overfitting the training data (high variance). Therefore, in the support vector machine, a very flexible kernel function leads to low bias but high variance."

    "text": "The idea of support vector machines does not generalize easily to the multiclass setting, but two options have been proposed.\nOne is called the one-versus-one approach, where a collection of models is built that each evaluate the question of whether the observation belongs to class \\(a\\) or class \\(b\\). This is repeated with all possible pairs of classes in the data. For a given test point, you tally how many times the observation is assigned to each of the \\(K\\) classes and assign whichever class was assigned most often.\nThe other is called the one-versus-all approach, where \\(K\\) models are built and each model compares the class at hand to a collection of the other \\(K-1\\) classes, coded collectively as -1. For a given test point, you determine which \\(f_k(x)\\) is largest (most confidence) and assign that class."

The School provides accommodations and support to students with documented disabilities on an individual, case-by-case basis. If students have a disability or think they may have a disability and would like to receive accommodations for their learning, they must disclose and provide medical documentation about their disability to Melissa Wojciechowski St. John. Melissa is the Senior Director of Student Services —and serves as the local disability coordinator— in the HKS Office of Student Services. She can talk to you about your needs and assist you in the process for requesting and implementing accommodations. Because accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, we recommend that you contact her as soon as possible.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty and Integrity\nAll students are expected to abide by the University policies on academic honesty and integrity as given in the Student Handbook. Violations of these policies will not be tolerated and are subject to severe sanctions up to and including expulsion from the university.\n\n\nHonor code\nStudents will have the flexibility to complete two quizzes during a window of 24 hours. Since students are allowed to access the questions at the time of their choice during that window, each student is expected to sign an honor code as they start their quiz.\n\n\nUse of electronics\nOur past experience suggests that student use of electronic devices can be very disruptive to the flow of the class. As a result, no mobile phones, tablets, PDAs, or laptops may be used in class. When an exercise in class (such as polling) requires the use of an electronic device, students will take out their devices for the exercise only and will stow the devices directly after the exercise. Please email your instructor to seek their written permission if you must use electronic devices due to special learning needs.\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\nTBA\n\n\nCommunication\nAll students are required to have email delivery for Canvas announcements enabled.

First, we will use principle components regression. Principle components regression does a linear regression but instead of using the X-variables as predictors, it uses principle components as predictors. The optimal number of principle components to use for PCR is usually found through cross-validation. To run PCR, we will use the package pls.\n\nlibrary(pls)\n\n## Try running PCR\npcr_fit  &lt;- pcr(logwage ~ ., data = wage_data[train,],          \n                scale = TRUE, validation = \"CV\")\n\nError in La.svd(X) : infinite or missing values in 'x'\nSometime you can get an error message. This error is because some of our variables have almost zero variance. Usually, variables with near-zero variance are indicator variables we generated for a rare event. Think about what happens to these predictors when the data are split into cross-validation/bootstrap sub-samples: if a few uncommon unique values are removed from one sample, the predictors could become zero-variance predictors which would cause many models to not run. We can figure out which variables have such low variance to determine how we want to handle them. The simplest approach to identify them is to set a manual threshold (which can be adjusted: 0.05 is a common choice). Our options are then to drop them from the analysis or not to scale the data.\n\n## to drop them from the analysis or not to scale the data. \nfor(col_num in 1:ncol(wage_data)){\n  if(var(wage_data[, col_num]) &lt; 0.05){\n    print(colnames(wage_data)[col_num])\n    print(var(wage_data[, col_num]))\n  }\n}\n\n[1] \"region_2.

    "text": "In this section we will briefly cover Neural Networks (NN), Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). For a more in-depth treatment of these topics, please consult the syllabus for suggested readings. The material in these notes draws on past notes by TFs Laura Morris, Emily Mower, and Amy Wickett.\n\n\nNNs are a subset of machine learning which is inspired by the human brain. They mimic how biological neurons communicate with one another to come up with a decision. The main idea behind neural networks is to extract linear combinations of features as new features and model the response variable as a nonlinear function of these new features.\nA NN consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The first layer receives raw input, it is processed by multiple hidden layers, and the last layer produces the result.\nDeep learning algorithms or deep NNs consist of multiple hidden layers and nodes. The word “deep” refers the depth of neural networks. They are generally used for solving complex problems such as Image classification, Speech recognition, and Text generation.\nWhen developing a NN model, we need to decide upon design, training, and level of learning.\n\n\nMultiple types of NNs are used for advanced machine-learning applications. In this section, we will cover the 2 popular types of NNs.\n\nFeedforward NNs:\n\nFeedforward NNs consist of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. It is called feedforward because the data flow in the forward direction. It is mostly used in Classification, Face recognition, and Pattern recognition. Convolutional NNs are examples of feedforward NNs.\n\nRecurrent NNs:\n\nRecurrent NNs are commonly used for sequential data such as texts, sequences of images, and time series. They are similar to feed-forward networks, except they get inputs from previous sequences using a feedback loop. Recurrent NNs are used in natural language processing (NLP), sales predictions, and weather forecasting. Hopfield NNs are examples of Recurrent NNs.\n\n\n\nWe use training data sets to train NNs. The rule of Thumb is that the number of training examples should be at least five to ten times the number of weights of the network. The most common training algorithm is called Backpropagation. The main steps of Backpropagation:\n\nRandomization: Start with small random weights\nForward Pass: Calculate the output and measure the errors\nBackward Pass: Use errors to adjust weights (supervised learning)\nLoop: Repeat this process until a stopping criterion is met\n\nUsing the example below, can you briefly explain how backpropagation works?\n\n\n\n\nThis step consists of deciding whether to use a NN with one hidden layer (shallow learning) or a NN with multiple hidden layers (deep learning).\n\n\n\n\nFor a more thorough treatment of reinforcement learning, I recommend Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, which is on the syllabus. In their book, they describe reinforcement learning as follows:\nReinforcement learning is learning what to do—how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. These two characteristics—trial-and-error search and delayed reward—are the two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning.}\nRL is a fascinating field, where agents learn policies (that is, rules regarding which action to take given the current state ) based on interacting with the environment and receiving rewards . Therefore, RL problems are often described by the tuple \\(\\{s, a, r\\}\\), which correspond to state, action, and reward. The idea is that the agent is in a current state \\(s\\) and can take any number of actions. For each action, the agent will transition to a new state \\(s'\\) and receive a reward \\(r'\\), which will both depend on which action the agent takes. Often, the reward will be zero for a very long time before a non-zero reward is achieved. Throughout the learning process, the agent faces a tradeoff between exploitation and exploration.\nThere are many forms of RL. Some are based on statistical models. These often involve updating the models using new observations and then sampling subsequent actions based on their estimated probability of being optimal.\nIn this class, we focused on examples of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). MDPs assume the Markov property holds. The Markov Property says that if I know the agent’s current state, then learning about the agent’s previous actions and states gives me no relevant information. In other words, I can ignore the agent’s history, since everything important from the past is captured in the agent’s present state and our current estimates of the environment. This is not always a reasonable assumption, but it is reasonable in the gridworld example that is commonly used to introduce people to MDPs.\nBelow is an example of gridworld. In gridworld, we assume that the agent is free to move between all the white boxes and will receive a reward of zero whenever he/she is in a white box. The agent cannot leave the grid or enter the black box. Any effort to move out of the grid or into the black box will result in the agent staying put. If the agent makes it to one of the boxes with +1 or -1, then the agent will receive the corresponding reward and will remain put forever (but will only collect the reward once – not each period). Often, the agent discounts future rewards using a discount factor \\(\\gamma\\), and sometimes the agent’s intended actions are perturbed by noise so that they only go in the intended direction with some probability \\(p\\).\nSuppose we want to figure out what the agent’s optimal policy would be, that is, for each white box, which action should the agent take? One way to figure this out is value iteration. Value iteration calculates the value of each action for each cell and then selects the action with the highest value. It repeats this process, updating its estimates of the values of the actions as it gets more information. Assume the discounting factor (\\(\\gamma\\)) is 0.8. In the gridworld example below, under the optimal policy, what is the value of being in each square?\n\nHint 1 : start from the square that is adjacent to the one with a reward of +1.\nHint 2: note that the value at each state is given by the equation:\n\\[\n    V^{*}(s) = \\max_{a}[r(s, a) + \\gamma V^{*}(\\delta (s, a))]\n\\]\nAs the example shows, value iteration is straightforward when you have information about your environment, such as the transition probabilities and rewards. There is an extension called Q-learning that can be used when you don’t have information about your environment, or at least don’t have full information about your environment, but you are still operating in a finite MDP. In Q-learning the agent follows a policy with some randomness to explore the space and updates its beliefs about optimal actions based on realized rewards. We will see an example of this problem in R."

    "text": "Reinforcement Learning\nThis part draws heavily from the “ReinforcementLearning” package vignette. The package can be found here.\n\n#install.packages(\"ReinforcementLearning\")\nlibrary(ReinforcementLearning)\n\nThis section demonstrates the capabilities of the ReinforcementLearning package with the help of a practical example, a Gridworld. The goal is to teach optimal movements to a robot in a grid-shaped maze (adapted from Sutton (1998)). Here the agent must navigate from a random starting position to a final position on a simulated 2×2 grid (see figure below). The reward structures are as follows: each movement leads to a negative reward of -1 to penalize routes that are not the shortest path. If the agent reaches the goal position, it earns a reward of 10.\nThe gridworld is defined as follows:\n|———–| | s1 | s4 | | s2 s3 | |———–|\nDefine the state and action sets, and load the built-in environment function for the 2×2 gridworld.\n\nstates &lt;- c(\"s1\", \"s2\", \"s3\", \"s4\")\nactions &lt;- c(\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\")\n\nLoad built-in environment function for 2x2 gridworld\n\nenv &lt;- gridworldEnvironment\nprint(env)\n\nfunction (state, action) \n{\n    next_state &lt;- state\n    if (state == state(\"s1\") && action == \"down\") \n        next_state &lt;- state(\"s2\")\n    if (state == state(\"s2\") && action == \"up\") \n        next_state &lt;- state(\"s1\")\n    if (state == state(\"s2\") && action == \"right\") \n        next_state &lt;- state(\"s3\")\n    if (state == state(\"s3\") && action == \"left\") \n        next_state &lt;- state(\"s2\")\n    if (state == state(\"s3\") && action == \"up\") \n        next_state &lt;- state(\"s4\")\n    if (next_state == state(\"s4\") && state != state(\"s4\")) {\n        reward &lt;- 10\n    }\n    else {\n        reward &lt;- -1\n    }\n    out &lt;- list(NextState = next_state, Reward = reward)\n    return(out)\n}\n&lt;bytecode: 0x116f617e8&gt;\n&lt;environment: namespace:ReinforcementLearning&gt;\n\n\nAfter having specified the environment function, we can use the built-in sampleExperience() function to sample observation sequences from the environment. The following code snippet generates a data frame data containing 1000 random state-transition tuples.\n\n?sampleExperience\n\ndata &lt;- sampleExperience(N = 1000, \n                         env = env, \n                         states = states, \n                         actions = actions)\nhead(data)\n\n  State Action Reward NextState\n1    s1  right     -1        s1\n2    s4  right     -1        s4\n3    s3     up     10        s4\n4    s1     up     -1        s1\n5    s4  right     -1        s4\n6    s2   left     -1        s2\n\n\nWe can now use the observation sequence in data in order to learn the optimal behavior of the agent. For this purpose, we first customize the learning behavior of the agent by defining a control object. We follow the default parameter choices and set the learning rate alpha to 0.1, the discount factor gamma to 0.5, and the exploration greediness epsilon to 0.1. Subsequently, we use the ReinforcementLearning() function to learn the best possible policy for the input data.\n\n# Define reinforcement learning parameters\ncontrol &lt;- list(alpha = 0.1, gamma = 0.5, epsilon = 0.1)\n\n# Perform reinforcement learning\n?ReinforcementLearning\nmodel &lt;- ReinforcementLearning(data, \n                               s = \"State\", \n                               a = \"Action\", \n                               r = \"Reward\", \n                               s_new = \"NextState\", \n                               control = control)\n\nEvaluating policy learning\n\n# Print policy\ncomputePolicy(model)\n\n     s1      s2      s3      s4 \n \"down\" \"right\"    \"up\"  \"left\" \n\n\nPrint state-action function\n\nprint(model)\n\nState-Action function Q\n        right        up       down       left\ns1 -0.6769943 -0.727481  0.7211750 -0.6641956\ns2  3.5459967 -0.711599  0.7227171  0.7305628\ns3  3.5167406  9.112867  3.5403134  0.7324369\ns4 -1.9264142 -1.906775 -1.9032334 -1.8981189\n\nPolicy\n     s1      s2      s3      s4 \n \"down\" \"right\"    \"up\"  \"left\" \n\nReward (last iteration)\n[1] -494\n\n\nPrint summary statistics\n\nsummary(model)\n\n\nModel details\nLearning rule:           experienceReplay\nLearning iterations:     1\nNumber of states:        4\nNumber of actions:       4\nTotal Reward:            -494\n\nReward details (per iteration)\nMin:                     -494\nMax:                     -494\nAverage:                 -494\nMedian:                  -494\nStandard deviation:      NA"

Students are expected to read the assigned material or watch the assigned videos before class. Students are expected to participate in class discussions, however, we recognize that some students may be more comfortable participating in class discussions in writing. We will provide opportunities for students to participate in class discussions via other modalities, such as Canvas discussion boards.\nParticipation will be self-assessed by students at the end of each unit. Students will be asked to reflect on their participation in class discussions and other activities.\n\n\nPractice Questions\nOur teaching fellow will hold bi-weekly “Guided problem solving sessions” that will be offer a chance for students to walk through key problem for the week. These sessions will be recorded and posted on Canvas. We will post a short set of questions after each class (on Canvas). Students are encouraged to work on these questions and bring them to the guided problem solving sessions.\nStudents will have access to a set of practice questions at the start of each week. They will be due at the end of each week. Each practice question set has an equal weight.\n\n\nEnd-of-Unit Assessments (EUA)\nStudents will have access to a set of assessment questions at the end of each unit. Questions will be available during a 24-hour window. Students will have 1 hour to complete the assessment on their own once they start it during this window. Each EUA has an equal weight. No additional preparation is required for EUAs.\n\n\nIn-Class Final Exam\nThe final exam will be held during the last class session. The final exam will be a closed-book exam. The final exam will be cumulative, covering all material from the course. The final exam will be held in class and will be proctored by the teaching team. The final exam will be 2 hours long."

    "text": "Part IV: SSH\nIn order to write code locally on our computer and be able to push to GitHub (or pull from GitHub) daily without constantly having to enter a username and password each time, we’re going to set up SSH keys.\n\nSSH keys come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub, and a private key that is stored only on your computer. If the keys match, you’re granted access.\nThe cryptography behind SSH keys ensures that no one can reverse engineer your private key from the public one.\nsource: https://jdblischak.github.io/2014-09-18-chicago/novice/git/05-sshkeys.html\n\nThe following steps are a simplification of the steps found in GitHub’s documentation. If you prefer, feel free to follow the steps at that link. Otherwise, for a simplified experience continue on below!\nSimplified Setup Steps\n\nStep 1: Check to see if you already have keys.\nRun the following command.\nls -al ~/.ssh/\nIf you see any output, that probably means you already have a public and private SSH key. If you have keys, you will most likely you will have two files, one named id_rsa (that contains your private key) and id_rsa.pub (that contains your public key).\nsidenote: Those files may also be named something like: id_ecdsa.pub or id_ed25519.pub. That just means you’re using a different encryption algorithm to generate your keys. You can learn more about that here if you chose to. Or, don’t worry about it and power on!\nIf you already have keys, continue to step 3. Otherwise, read on!\nStep 2: Create new SSH keys.\nRun the following comamnd, but makes sure to replace your_email@example.com with your own email address. Use the same email address you used to sign up to GitHub with.\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\nYou may then see a prompt like the one below. Just hit enter to save the key in the default location.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/jacob/.ssh/id_rsa):\nAfter that, the system will prompt you to enter a passphrase. We’re not going to use a passphrase here, so just go ahead and leave that blank and hit enter twice.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nEnter same passphrase again:\nFinally you should see some randomart that looks like this\nYour identification has been saved in /Users/jacob/.ssh/id_rsa.\nYour public key has been saved in /Users/jacob/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\nThe key fingerprint is:\nSHA256:2AazdvCBP8d1li9tF8cszM2KbtjPe7iwfCK8gUgzIGY your_email@example.com\nThe key's randomart image is:\n+---[RSA 4096]----+\n|                 |\n|       .     o * |\n|  E . = .   . B.*|\n| o . . X o . + =o|\n|      B S o . o =|\n|     o * + +   o.|\n|      . ..o =  . |\n|          o+.=o .|\n|          .ooo=+ |\n+----[SHA256]-----+\nStep 3: Add your key to GitHub\nRun the following command to view your public key\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nNavigate to https://github.com/settings/keys and hit “New SSH key”. Paste the SSH key from the last command into the text box as shown below and then hit “Add SSH key”. Make sure you copy paste exactly. The key will likely start with ssh_rsa and end with your email address. You can give the key a title like “My Macbook Pro” so you know which computer this key comes from.\n\nStep 4: Verify that it worked!\nRun the following command to test your computer’s SSH connection to GitHub\nssh -T git@github.com\nIf the connection is successful, you will see a message like this\n&gt; Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not\n&gt; provide shell access.\n\n\nRecap: What did we just do?\nWe just created a public/private SSH Key pair. There is now a folder on your computer called .ssh (it is a hidden folder, hidden folders have names that start with .). You can run this command to see the files in that folder.\nls -al ~/.ssh/\nid_rsa.pub contains your public key, you can see what that looks like by running:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nid_rsa contains your private key, you can see what that looks like by running:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nThis public and private key pair are mathematically linked. As the name suggests, you can share your public key far and wide, but must keep your private key safe and secure. Since you have shared your public key with GitHub, your computer can encrypt files with your private key and send them to GitHub. Since GitHub has your public key, it can match that file and verify that it is coming from you. Your computer can now securely communicate with GitHub without needing a username and password every time.\nTo get started with Git, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the installer from the Git website. Once you have Git installed, you can use the git command in your terminal to interact with Git."

    "text": "Linear regression is a fundamental tool for modeling relationships between an outcome variable and one or more predictors. Traditionally, we often do this via ordinary least squares (OLS). In the frequentist approach, we estimate regression coefficients by finding values that best explain the observed data. The uncertainty in these estimates is represented by confidence intervals (CIs), which describe the expected variation if we were to repeat the entire data-collection process many times.\nHowever, confidence intervals are often misinterpreted. Many people assume a 95% confidence interval means, “There is a 95% probability that the true parameter lies within this interval.” In reality, this is incorrect—CIs do not assign probabilities to parameters. Instead, they describe how often the interval would contain the true parameter across many repeated samples, which is not the way we typically think about uncertainty.\nIn contrast, Bayesian credible intervals behave the way we actually want these things to work. A 95% credible interval does mean that, given our observed data and model, “There is a 95% probability that the true parameter lies within this range.” This makes Bayesian inference particularly appealing when we want intuitive probability statements about our parameters.\nBayesian linear regression treats model parameters (e.g., intercept, slope) as random variables with their own probability distributions. Instead of producing a single “best” estimate for each coefficient, we derive a posterior distribution, which represents a range of possible values for each parameter, given both:\n\nOur prior beliefs (before seeing the data)\nThe likelihood of the observed data under the model assumptions\n\nThe result is a credible interval, which gives us a direct probability statement about our parameters, making it a powerful tool in statistical modeling.\nIn this post, we’ll work through an example in R to see:\n\nHow the posterior distribution updates from the prior distribution.\nHow to visualize priors versus posteriors.\nHow to interpret Bayesian predictions (including posterior predictive distributions)."

This posterior distribution directly shows which parameter values are plausible (or implausible) after seeing the data. We can then summarize the posterior using credible intervals, which have the straightforward interpretation: “Given our model and data, there is a 95% probability that the true parameter is in this interval.”\nIn this post, we’ll do a simple example in R to see:\n\nHow the posterior distribution updates from the prior distribution.\nHow to visualize priors versus posteriors.\nHow to interpret Bayesian predictions (including posterior predictive distributions)."

    "text": "Linear regression is a fundamental tool for modeling relationships between an outcome variable and one or more predictors. Traditionally, we often do this via ordinary least squares (OLS). In the frequentist approach, we estimate regression coefficients by finding values that best explain the observed data. The uncertainty in these estimates is represented by confidence intervals (CIs), which describe the expected variation if we were to repeat the entire data-collection process many times.\nHowever, confidence intervals are often misinterpreted. Many people assume a 95% confidence interval means, “There is a 95% probability that the true parameter lies within this interval.” In reality, this is incorrect—CIs do not assign probabilities to parameters. Instead, they describe how often the interval would contain the true parameter across many repeated samples, which is not the way we typically think about uncertainty.\nIn contrast, Bayesian credible intervals behave the way we actually want these things to work. A 95% credible interval does mean that, given our observed data and model, “There is a 95% probability that the true parameter lies within this range.” This makes Bayesian inference particularly appealing when we want intuitive probability statements about our parameters.\nBayesian linear regression treats model parameters (e.g., intercept, slope) as random variables with their own probability distributions. Instead of producing a single “best” estimate for each coefficient, we derive a posterior distribution, which represents a range of possible values for each parameter, given both:\n\nOur prior beliefs (before seeing the data)\nThe likelihood of the observed data under the model assumptions\n\nThe result is a credible interval, which gives us a direct probability statement about our parameters, making it a powerful tool in statistical modeling.\nIn this post, we’ll work through an example in R to see:\n\nHow the posterior distribution updates from the prior distribution.\nHow to visualize priors versus posteriors.\nHow to interpret Bayesian predictions (including posterior predictive distributions)."

However, in most real-world applications, we’re not just interested in estimating coefficients—we want to use our model to make predictions about future observations.\nIn a frequentist regression, we typically obtain a point prediction:\n\\[\n\\hat{y}_* = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_*\n\\]\nalong with a prediction interval that accounts for both residual variability and parameter uncertainty.\n\nThe Bayesian Approach: Uncertainty in Predictions\nIn Bayesian regression, we don’t just compute a single best guess for \\(y_*\\)—we generate an entire posterior predictive distribution, which tells us:\n\nThe most likely values of \\(y_*\\) based on our model.\nThe full range of plausible values, incorporating both parameter uncertainty and residual variability.\nThe probability of exceeding a critical threshold, which is extremely useful for decision-making.\n\nExample Use Case:\n\nSuppose \\(x_* = 2.5\\) represents the duration of a hospital stay, and \\(y_*\\) represents the total cost of treatment (in thousands).\nA hospital administrator might ask:\n\n“What is the probability that this patient’s costs will exceed $10,000?”\n“How much uncertainty is there in our cost estimate?”\n\nInstead of a single prediction, the Bayesian posterior predictive distribution provides a full range of possible outcomes, making it much more informative.\n\n\n\nSimulating from the Posterior Predictive Distribution\nWe generate predictions for a new observation \\(x_*\\) by sampling from the posterior:\n\\[\ny_* \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_*, \\sigma^2)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma\\) are drawn from their posterior distributions.\nLet’s compute this for \\(x_* = 2.5\\) and visualize the range of plausible values for \\(y_*\\).\n\n# Posterior draws for intercept, slope, and sigma\npost_draws_full &lt;- as.matrix(custom_bayes_model)\n\n# Function to simulate predictions from posterior\nsimulate_posterior_y &lt;- function(x_star, n_sims=4000) {\n  idx_int &lt;- which(colnames(post_draws_full)==\"(Intercept)\")\n  idx_slope &lt;- which(colnames(post_draws_full)==\"x\")\n  idx_sigma &lt;- which(colnames(post_draws_full)==\"sigma\")\n\n  intercept_samples &lt;- post_draws_full[, idx_int]\n  slope_samples     &lt;- post_draws_full[, idx_slope]\n  sigma_samples     &lt;- post_draws_full[, idx_sigma]\n\n  # Compute predicted means, then sample from Normal(mean, sigma)\n  mu_star &lt;- intercept_samples + slope_samples * x_star\n  y_sim &lt;- rnorm(n_sims, mean=mu_star, sd=sigma_samples)\n  y_sim\n}\n\nx_star &lt;- 2.5\ny_sim &lt;- simulate_posterior_y(x_star)\n\n# Probability that y_* &gt; 10\nmean(y_sim &gt; 10)\n\n[1] 0.72675\n\n\nA histogram of simulated outcomes shows the full range of possible \\(y_*\\) values, allowing us to make probability-based decisions.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(data.frame(y_sim), aes(y_sim)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=30, fill=\"#D55E00\", color=\"white\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=10, color=\"black\", linetype=\"solid\", size=1.5) +\n  labs(title=\"Posterior Predictive Distribution at x=2.5\",\n       subtitle=\"Black line = threshold of 10\",\n       x=\"Possible y* values\", y=\"Frequency\")\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the probability that \\(y_*\\) exceeds $10,000 is approximately 73%. This information is crucial for making informed decisions about resource allocation, risk management, or policy interventions."

However, in most real-world applications, we’re not just interested in estimating coefficients—we want to use our model to make predictions about future observations.\nIn a frequentist regression, we typically obtain a point prediction:\n\\[\n\\hat{y}_* = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_*\n\\]\nalong with a prediction interval that accounts for both residual variability and parameter uncertainty.\n\nThe Bayesian Approach: Uncertainty in Predictions\nIn Bayesian regression, we don’t just compute a single best guess for \\(y_*\\)—we generate an entire posterior predictive distribution, which tells us:\n\nThe most likely values of \\(y_*\\) based on our model.\nThe full range of plausible values, incorporating both parameter uncertainty and residual variability.\nThe probability of exceeding a critical threshold, which is extremely useful for decision-making.\n\nExample Use Case:\n\nSuppose \\(x_* = 2.5\\) represents the duration of a hospital stay, and \\(y_*\\) represents the total cost of treatment (in thousands).\nA hospital administrator might ask:\n\n“What is the probability that this patient’s costs will exceed $10,000?”\n“How much uncertainty is there in our cost estimate?”\n\nInstead of a single prediction, the Bayesian posterior predictive distribution provides a full range of possible outcomes, making it much more informative.\n\n\n\nSimulating from the Posterior Predictive Distribution\nWe generate predictions for a new observation \\(x_*\\) by sampling from the posterior:\n\\[\ny_* \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_*, \\sigma^2)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma\\) are drawn from their posterior distributions.\nLet’s compute this for \\(x_* = 2.5\\) and visualize the range of plausible values for \\(y_*\\).\n\n# Posterior draws for intercept, slope, and sigma\npost_draws_full &lt;- as.matrix(custom_bayes_model)\n\n# Function to simulate predictions from posterior\nsimulate_posterior_y &lt;- function(x_star, n_sims=4000) {\n  idx_int &lt;- which(colnames(post_draws_full)==\"(Intercept)\")\n  idx_slope &lt;- which(colnames(post_draws_full)==\"x\")\n  idx_sigma &lt;- which(colnames(post_draws_full)==\"sigma\")\n\n  intercept_samples &lt;- post_draws_full[, idx_int]\n  slope_samples     &lt;- post_draws_full[, idx_slope]\n  sigma_samples     &lt;- post_draws_full[, idx_sigma]\n\n  # Compute predicted means, then sample from Normal(mean, sigma)\n  mu_star &lt;- intercept_samples + slope_samples * x_star\n  y_sim &lt;- rnorm(n_sims, mean=mu_star, sd=sigma_samples)\n  y_sim\n}\n\nx_star &lt;- 2.5\ny_sim &lt;- simulate_posterior_y(x_star)\n\n# Probability that y_* &gt; 10\nmean(y_sim &gt; 10)\n\n[1] 0.72675\n\n\nA histogram of simulated outcomes shows the full range of possible \\(y_*\\) values, allowing us to make probability-based decisions.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(data.frame(y_sim), aes(y_sim)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=30, fill=\"#D55E00\", color=\"white\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=10, color=\"black\", linetype=\"solid\", size=1.5) +\n  labs(title=\"Posterior Predictive Distribution at x=2.5\",\n       subtitle=\"Black line = threshold of 10\",\n       x=\"Possible y* values\", y=\"Frequency\")\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the probability that \\(y_*\\) exceeds $10,000 is approximately 73%.

It states that in the absence of treatment, the difference between treatment and control groups would have remained constant over time. This allows us to attribute any deviation from this pattern to the causal effect of the intervention.\nHowever, in health policy research, this assumption often fails for several reasons:\n\nHealth outcomes frequently have complex, non-linear trajectories\nTreatment assignment may be related to pre-existing trends (e.g., policies targeting areas with worsening health metrics)\nAnticipation effects may cause behavior changes before policy implementation\nDifferential shocks to treatment and control groups before the policy\n\nWhen parallel trends are violated, traditional DiD estimates become biased, potentially leading to incorrect policy conclusions."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWhen evaluating policy interventions, the reliability of our estimates hinges on the validity of model assumptions. While DiD remains a powerful tool when its assumptions hold, autoregressive models offer a valuable alternative when parallel trends are violated.\nBy explicitly modeling the dynamic relationship between past and current outcomes, these models can deliver more accurate causal estimates in complex policy environments. Rather than viewing them as competitors, researchers should understand the strengths and limitations of both approaches, selecting the appropriate method based on the specific context and data characteristics.\nIn health policy research, where outcomes often follow complex trajectories and policy implementations are frequently endogenous to pre-existing trends, the autoregressive approach offers a flexible framework that can accommodate these realities while still enabling credible causal inference."

This creates correlation between your instrument and the error term—exactly what IV is supposed to avoid.\n\n\n\nThe paper proposes the Unbiased Jackknife Instrumental Variables Estimator (UJIVE), which uses leave-one-out estimation to break the mechanical correlation. When constructing the instrument for observation \\(i\\), UJIVE estimates all examiner leniencies using data excluding observation \\(i\\). Simple idea, big consequences.\n\n\nI’ll walk you through the paper’s key results using interactive simulations that let you see the bias in real-time. We’ll cover:\n\nQuick refresher on leniency designs (you probably know this, but let’s set notation)\nThe many-weak instrument problem (why 2SLS fails, with simulations)\nWhy standard errors are wrong too (not just point estimates)\nThe UJIVE solution (how leave-one-out fixes everything)\nEmpirical re-analysis (Farre-Mensa et al. 2020 on patents)\nPractical guidelines (5-step checklist for your next paper)\n\nThe bottom line: if you’re using leniency designs, you should probably switch from 2SLS to UJIVE. Let me show you why."

    "text": "The Setup: Why We Need Instruments\nLet’s start with the patent example. We want to know: Does getting a patent cause startups to be more innovative?\nThe outcome equation is straightforward:\n\\[y_i = \\gamma + \\beta x_i + \\varepsilon_i\\]\nwhere: - \\(y_i\\) is future innovation (e.g., number of future patent applications) - \\(x_i\\) is whether patent \\(i\\) was approved (0 or 1) - \\(\\beta\\) is the causal effect we want to estimate - \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) captures unobserved factors\n\nThe Selection Problem\nThe challenge is selection bias. Startups with strong applications (high \\(\\varepsilon_i\\)) are both:\n\nMore likely to get their patents approved\nMore likely to be innovative in the future anyway\n\nThis creates a positive correlation between \\(x_i\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\), meaning OLS will overestimate the true causal effect.\nLet’s simulate this to see it in action:\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nset.seed(42)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nn &lt;- 500\ntrue_effect &lt;- 0.25\n\n# Generate data with selection\nsimulate_selection_data &lt;- function() {\n  data &lt;- tibble(\n    startup_id = 1:n,\n    # Unobserved quality (part of epsilon)\n    quality = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1),\n    # Approval depends on quality (selection!)\n    approval_prob = pnorm(quality * 0.8),\n    approved = rbinom(n, 1, approval_prob),\n    # Outcome depends on quality AND treatment\n    innovation = 5 + true_effect * approved + quality + rnorm(n, 0, 0.5)\n  )\n  return(data)\n}\n\ndata_selected &lt;- simulate_selection_data()\n\n# Compare OLS to truth\nols_estimate &lt;- coef(lm(innovation ~ approved, data = data_selected))[\"approved\"]\n\n# Visualize the selection problem\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data_selected, aes(x = quality, y = innovation, color = factor(approved))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, size = 1.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"0\" = \"#e74c3c\", \"1\" = \"#27ae60\"),\n    labels = c(\"Denied\", \"Approved\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Selection Problem\",\n    subtitle = sprintf(\"OLS estimates effect = %.3f, but true effect = %.3f\", \n                      ols_estimate, true_effect),\n    x = \"Startup Quality (Unobserved)\",\n    y = \"Future Innovation\",\n    color = \"Patent Status\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#666666\")\n  )\n\nprint(p1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows the problem clearly: approved startups (green) have higher innovation partly because they were approved, but also because they had higher quality to begin with.

    "text": "The Many-Examiner Problem\nIn reality, patent offices don’t have two examiners—they have hundreds or thousands. With \\(K\\) examiners, we need \\(K-1\\) instruments (one indicator for each examiner, dropping one reference category).\nThis creates a problem called many-weak instrument bias.\n\nWhy 2SLS Breaks Down\nHere’s the subtle issue with two-stage least squares (2SLS):\n\nFirst stage: Regress approval on all examiner dummies to get predicted approval \\(\\hat{x}_i\\)\nSecond stage: Regress outcome on predicted approval\n\nThe problem? To predict approval for application \\(i\\), 2SLS calculates examiner \\(j\\)’s approval rate using all applications assigned to \\(j\\)—including application \\(i\\) itself!\nThis creates a mechanical correlation between the instrument and the error term. The very thing we’re trying to avoid.\nLet me show you how bad it gets:\n\n    Figure 3: Many-Examiner Bias Increases with K\n    \n        \n            Number of examiners (K):\n            \n            50\n        \n        \n            Sample size (n):\n            \n            1000\n        \n        Run Simulation (500 iterations)\n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nThe problem is clear: As the number of examiners (K) increases relative to sample size, 2SLS becomes increasingly biased toward OLS. Even when examiners collectively explain meaningful variation, the mechanical correlation pulls 2SLS estimates toward the biased OLS estimates.\n\n\n\nThe Bias Formula\nUnder homoskedasticity, the 2SLS bias can be approximated as:\n\\[\\text{Bias}(2SLS) \\approx \\text{Bias}(OLS) \\times \\frac{1}{E[F]}\\]\nwhere \\(E[F]\\) is the expected first-stage F-statistic. The famous “F &gt; 10” rule of thumb comes from wanting 2SLS bias to be less than 10% of OLS bias.\nBut with many examiners, even when they collectively explain meaningful variation, \\(F\\) can be small because it’s divided by \\(K\\)."

Identify Necessary Controls\nUse institutional knowledge to determine what makes assignment as-good-as-random.\nPatent example: Assignment is random within art unit × year, so these are necessary controls.\n\n\n2. Test Balance\nRun UJIVE with predetermined covariates as outcomes. Significant coefficients = red flag.\nWhy UJIVE for balance tests? Same estimator, consistent approach. Other approaches (regressing covariates on constructed leniency) can show spurious imbalance due to finite-sample bias.\n\n\n3. Estimate with UJIVE\nUse UJIVE as primary estimator. Report 2SLS and OLS for comparison.\nSoftware: Authors provide R package at github.com/kolesarm/ManyIV\nlibrary(ManyIV)\nresult &lt;- ujive(\n  formula = outcome ~ treatment | examiner_dummies | controls,\n  data = your_data\n)\n\n\n4. Test Monotonicity\nFor heterogeneous effects interpretation (LATE), you need monotonicity: no defiers.\nTest: Run UJIVE with outcome = indicator(outcome value) × treatment. Estimates should be ∈ [0,1].\nWhat it tests: “Average monotonicity”—average leniency of examiners who’d approve exceeds those who’d deny.\n\n\n5. Characterize Compliers\nRun UJIVE with covariate × treatment as outcome to estimate complier characteristics.\nWhy: Check external validity. If compliers look very different from full sample, LATE estimates may not generalize."

    "text": "Conclusion\nLeniency designs offer a powerful way to estimate causal effects when randomization isn’t possible. But as we’ve seen, the details of implementation matter enormously. Using 2SLS with many examiners can lead to biased estimates and misleadingly small standard errors—making weak effects look strong and uncertain effects look precise.\nUJIVE provides a robust solution that works even when you have hundreds of decision-makers and complex control structures. The leave-one-out principle is simple but profound: by excluding each observation from its own instrument calculation, we break the mechanical correlation that plagues standard approaches.\nFor researchers using leniency designs, the message is clear: use UJIVE, not 2SLS. Your estimates will be more credible, your standard errors will be honest, and your conclusions will be more reliable."

    "text": "Quick Refresher: The Leniency Design\nYou probably know this cold, but let’s establish notation. Consider the outcome equation:\n\\[y_i = \\gamma + \\beta x_i + \\varepsilon_i\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(y_i\\) is the outcome (e.g., future innovation for startup \\(i\\))\n\\(x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) is treatment (e.g., patent approval)\n\\(\\beta\\) is the causal effect we want\n\\(\\varepsilon_i\\) captures unobservables\n\nThe identification problem: \\(x_i\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) are correlated. Patents go to better startups, bail is granted to safer defendants, etc. OLS is biased.\nThe leniency design solution: Cases are randomly assigned to decision-makers \\(j = 1, \\ldots, K\\) who vary in leniency. Let \\(z_i\\) be a vector of examiner indicators (one for each examiner, minus a reference category). The first-stage regression is:\n\\[x_i = z_i'\\pi + w_i'\\delta + \\nu_i\\]\nwhere \\(w_i\\) are necessary controls (e.g., art unit × year FE in patent setting) and \\(\\pi\\) captures examiner leniencies relative to the omitted examiner.\nWhy it works: Random assignment means \\(z_i \\perp \\varepsilon_i | w_i\\). Variation in leniency means \\(\\pi \\neq 0\\). Standard 2SLS instruments with \\(z_i\\) (controlling for \\(w_i\\)) to estimate \\(\\beta\\).\n\nThe Simple Two-Examiner Case\nTo build intuition, consider just two examiners: one tough (\\(t\\)), one soft (\\(s\\)). Let \\(p_t\\) and \\(p_s\\) be their approval rates, with \\(p_s &gt; p_t\\). With a single binary instrument \\(z_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) indicating assignment to the soft examiner, the IV estimator simplifies to the Wald estimator:\n\\[\\hat{\\beta}_{IV} = \\frac{E[y_i | z_i = 1] - E[y_i | z_i = 0]}{E[x_i | z_i = 1] - E[x_i | z_i = 0]} = \\frac{\\bar{y}_s - \\bar{y}_t}{p_s - p_t}\\]\nLet’s see this in action:\n\n    Figure 1: The Two-Examiner IV Estimator\n    \n        \n            Tough examiner approval rate:\n            \n            0.40\n        \n        \n            Soft examiner approval rate:\n            \n            0.70\n        \n        Regenerate Data\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\nWith just two examiners, IV works beautifully. The estimate recovers the true effect. Standard errors are straightforward (het-robust, no clustering needed since assignment is iid).\nThe key insight: This works because examiner assignment is uncorrelated with \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) by random assignment. The Wald estimator identifies a local average treatment effect (LATE) for compliers—cases that would be approved by the soft examiner but denied by the tough one."

    "section": "The Problem: Many Instruments",
    "text": "The Problem: Many Instruments\nIn practice, you never have two examiners. Patent offices have hundreds of examiners, courts have dozens of judges, disability offices have many screeners. With \\(K\\) examiners, you have \\(K-1\\) instruments (the examiner dummies).\nThis is where things break down.\n\nThe Mechanical Correlation\nThe standard 2SLS approach:\n\nFirst stage: Regress \\(x_i\\) on all examiner dummies \\(z_i\\) (and controls \\(w_i\\))\nGet predicted values: \\(\\hat{x}_i = z_i'\\hat{\\pi} + w_i'\\hat{\\delta}\\)\nSecond stage: Regress \\(y_i\\) on \\(\\hat{x}_i\\) (and controls)\n\nHere’s the problem: \\(\\hat{x}_i\\) is the predicted approval probability for application \\(i\\) based on examiner \\(j\\)’s approval rate. But that approval rate is calculated using all observations assigned to examiner \\(j\\)—including observation \\(i\\) itself!\nIf examiner \\(j\\) handled 50 cases and observation \\(i\\) is one of them, then \\(\\hat{x}_i\\) is mechanically correlated with \\(x_i\\). And since \\(x_i\\) is correlated with \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) (that’s why we need IV!), this means \\(\\hat{x}_i\\) is correlated with \\(\\varepsilon_i\\).\nYour instrument is contaminated.\n\nThe Bias Formula\nUnder homoskedasticity, the paper shows that 2SLS bias can be approximated as:\n\\[\\text{Bias}(2SLS) \\approx \\text{Bias}(OLS) \\times \\frac{1}{E[F]}\\]\nwhere \\(E[F]\\) is the expected value of the first-stage F-statistic.\nThe famous “F &gt; 10” rule of thumb says you want \\(E[F] &gt; 10\\) to keep 2SLS bias below 10% of OLS bias. But with many examiners, \\(E[F]\\) can be small even when examiners collectively explain meaningful variation, because \\(F\\) is divided by \\(K-1\\).\nKey insight from the paper: The bias isn’t just about weak instruments in the traditional sense. Even with “strong enough” first stages, the own-observation contamination creates bias.\n\n\n\nSimulation: Watching the Bias Grow\nLet’s see this in action. I’ll simulate data with many examiners and show how 2SLS gets pulled toward OLS as \\(K\\) increases:\n\n    Figure 2: The Many-Examiner Bias Problem\n    \n        \n            Number of examiners (K):\n            \n            50\n        \n        \n            Sample size (n):\n            \n            1000\n        \n        Run Simulation (500 iterations)\n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nWhat you’re seeing: As \\(K\\) increases relative to \\(n\\), 2SLS (blue) gets pulled toward OLS (red). UJIVE (purple) stays centered on the true effect. This isn’t a weak instruments problem in the traditional sense—the examiners collectively explain meaningful variation. It’s the mechanical correlation from including own-observation data.\n\n\n\nThe Standard Error Problem\nBut wait, there’s more! The bias in point estimates is only half the story. The paper shows that 2SLS standard errors are also wrong—and in a way that masks the bias problem.\nLook at the distributions above. Notice how 2SLS (blue) is super concentrated? That narrow spike means small variance, which means small standard errors. But those small SEs aren’t reflecting true precision—they’re an artifact of the same overfitting that causes the bias.\nHere’s what happens:\n\n2SLS overstates the predictive power of the instruments (includes own-observation data)\nThis inflates the denominator in the IV formula: \\(\\sum \\hat{\\ell}_i^2\\) instead of \\(\\sum \\tilde{\\ell}_i^2\\)\nThe SE formula has that same denominator, so SEs are too small\nResult: you get tight confidence intervals around a biased estimate\n\nThis is dangerous. You see small p-values and think you’ve precisely estimated a large effect. In reality, you’ve imprecisely estimated a smaller effect.\nUJIVE fixes both problems. That wider purple distribution reflects honest uncertainty—larger SEs that correctly account for: - Estimation error in leniency measures - Heterogeneous treatment effects across complier groups\n- Many-instrument uncertainty\n\nThe tradeoff: UJIVE sacrifices some efficiency (larger SEs) to eliminate bias and get correct inference. 2SLS looks precise but is both biased and has wrong SEs. You’d rather have honest uncertainty around an unbiased estimate than false precision around a biased one."

    "section": "The Solution: UJIVE",
    "text": "The Solution: UJIVE\nThe fix is elegant. Instead of including observation \\(i\\) when estimating its examiner’s leniency, leave it out.\n\nThe Leave-One-Out Principle\nFor each observation \\(i\\) assigned to examiner \\(j\\):\n\nEstimate examiner \\(j\\)’s leniency using all observations except \\(i\\): \\[\\hat{\\ell}_{-i}\\]\nUse this leave-one-out leniency as the instrument for \\(i\\)\nRepeat for all observations\n\nThis breaks the mechanical correlation. Since \\(\\hat{\\ell}_{-i}\\) doesn’t depend on \\(x_i\\), it can’t be mechanically correlated with \\(\\varepsilon_i\\).\nLet me visualize exactly what this means:\n\n    Figure 3: The Leave-One-Out Principle\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nThe UJIVE Estimator\nFormally, UJIVE is:\n\\[\\hat{\\beta}_{UJIVE} = \\frac{\\sum_i \\hat{\\ell}_{-i} y_i}{\\sum_i \\hat{\\ell}_{-i} x_i}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\ell}_{-i}\\) is the leave-one-out predicted leniency for observation \\(i\\).\nWhy this works: Since \\(\\hat{\\ell}_{-i}\\) doesn’t use \\(i\\)’s own data, it’s independent of \\((x_i, \\varepsilon_i)\\) conditional on \\(w_i\\). No mechanical correlation, no bias.\nKey properties: - Approximately unbiased even with many weak instruments - Correct standard errors accounting for heterogeneous effects - Doesn’t require strong first stage (\\(F &gt; 10\\) rule doesn’t apply) - Computationally simple (one-step estimator)\n\n\n\nDoes It Actually Work?\nLet’s run a big simulation comparing all three estimators:\n\n    Figure 4: Full Comparison - 1,000 Simulations\n    \n        \n        \n            Run 1,000 Simulations (K=50, n=1000)\n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nThe key takeaway: Look at the standard deviations in the table. UJIVE has larger SD (and thus larger standard errors) than 2SLS. This is a feature, not a bug. UJIVE’s wider distribution reflects honest uncertainty—it correctly accounts for estimation error in leniency measures and heterogeneous effects. 2SLS’s tight distribution is false precision.\nYou’d rather have truthful uncertainty around an unbiased estimate than false confidence around a biased one."

    "section": "Empirical Application: Patent Values Revisited",
    "text": "Empirical Application: Patent Values Revisited\nNow let’s see this in practice. The paper re-analyzes Farre-Mensa, Hegde, and Ljungqvist (2020), who use patent examiner assignment to estimate how patent approval affects startup innovation.\nSetting: - 32,514 first-time patent applications by US startups (2001-2013) - ~1,200 patent examiners - Random assignment within art unit × year - Outcomes: Future patent applications, approvals, citations\nOriginal approach: Constructed leniency measure (similar to JIVE)\nThis paper’s re-analysis: Compare UJIVE, 2SLS with examiner dummies, and OLS\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\nUJIVE\n2SLS (examiners)\nOLS\n\n\n\n\nAny subsequent application\n0.173(0.055)\n0.232(0.016)\n0.234(0.006)\n\n\nLog(1 + applications)\n0.323(0.100)\n0.374(0.027)\n0.357(0.009)\n\n\nAny subsequent approval\n0.259(0.050)\n0.240(0.014)\n0.223(0.005)\n\n\nLog(1 + approvals)\n0.356(0.081)\n0.323(0.021)\n0.291(0.007)\n\n\nAny citations\n0.183(0.049)\n0.173(0.014)\n0.164(0.005)\n\n\nLog(1 + citations)\n0.419(0.125)\n0.372(0.033)\n0.339(0.011)\n\n\n\nStandard errors in parentheses\n\n\nWhat Changed?\n\nThree things to notice:\n\nPoint estimates: UJIVE estimates are somewhat smaller than 2SLS for some outcomes (e.g., “Any subsequent application”: 0.173 vs 0.232). The 2SLS estimates were being pulled toward OLS (0.234).\nStandard errors: UJIVE SEs are 3-4× larger! For “Any subsequent application”: UJIVE SE is 0.055 vs 2SLS SE of 0.016. This isn’t UJIVE being inefficient—2SLS SEs were artificially small.\nSubstantive conclusions: Effects are still significant and economically meaningful:\n\nPatent approval increases probability of future applications by 17pp\nIncreases probability of future approvals by 26pp\nIncreases citations by 18pp\n\n\nBut the effects are more modest than 2SLS suggested, and we’re appropriately less certain about them."

This batch vs. sequence decision affects both efficiency and diagnostic quality—but we know little about how physicians actually make it. Using EMR data from 50,000+ ED visits, I document substantial physician-level variation in batching tendencies and estimate that high-batching physicians have 4.5% longer patient stays but 14.8% fewer 72-hour return admissions.
