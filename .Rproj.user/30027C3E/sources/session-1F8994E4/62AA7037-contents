## Philosphy

*An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.* - **J. Buckheit and D. Donoho**


I am committed to open science principles and research reproducibility. You can find the code repositories for my academic papers on my [Github](https://github.com/jacobjameson).



## [Introduction to R Programming](Data/Intro_R_Course/Intro R.html)

This page contains the content for the "Introduction to Data Analysis in R" mini-course. The goal is to introduce R programming concepts with a focus on preparing and analyzing data, and conducting statistical simulations. We will cover how to read data into R, manipulate data with a suite of tools from the tidyverse package dplyr. We will also discuss some basic programming concepts including data types and operators. This mini-course is aimed at people with no programming background that are looking for a gentle and practical introduction to data analysis in R.
