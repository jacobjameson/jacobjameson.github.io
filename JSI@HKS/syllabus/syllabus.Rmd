### Course Requirements and Grading

- Participation	20%
- Practice questions	20%
- End-of-Unit Assessments (4)	20%
- In-Class Final Exam	40%



### Participation 

- Attendance and participation in class discussions are essential.
- Students are expected to read the assigned material before class.
- Students are expected to participate in class discussions

### Practice questions

Short set of questions after each class (on Canvas). Guided problem solving sessions and office hours will help students prepare for these. 

### End-of-Unit Assessments (EUA)

Students will have access to a set of assessment questions at the end of each unit. Questions will be available during a 24-hour window. Students will have 1 hour to complete the assessment on their own once they start it during this window. Each EUA has an equal weight. No additional preparation is required for EUAs.

### In-Class Final Exam

## Learning Community and Norms

### Accessibility and Accommodations for Student Learning 

Harvard Kennedy School is committed to the full inclusion of students with disabilities (learning, mental-health related, physical, chronic illness, temporary injury, etc.). The School provides accommodations and support to students with documented disabilities on an individual, case-by-case basis. If students have a disability or think they may have a disability and would like to receive accommodations for their learning, they must disclose and provide medical documentation about their disability to Melissa Wojciechowski St. John. Melissa is the Senior Director of Student Services —and serves as the local disability coordinator— in the HKS Office of Student Services. She can talk to you about your needs and assist you in the process for requesting and implementing accommodations. Because accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, we recommend that you contact her as soon as possible.

### Academic Honesty and Integrity

All students are expected to abide by the University policies on academic honesty and integrity as given in the Student Handbook. Violations of these policies will not be tolerated and are subject to severe sanctions up to and including expulsion from the university. 

### Honor code

Students will have the flexibility to complete two quizzes during a window of 24 hours. Since students are allowed to access the questions at the time of their choice during that window, each student is expected to sign an honor code as they start their quiz. 

### Use of electronics
 
Our past experience suggests that student use of electronic devices can be very disruptive to the flow of the class. As a result, no mobile phones, tablets, PDAs, or laptops may be used in class. When an exercise in class (such as polling) requires the use of an electronic device, students will take out their devices for the exercise only and will stow the devices directly after the exercise. Please email your instructor to seek their written permission if you must use electronic devices due to special learning needs.

### Attendance and Participation

TBA


### Communication 

All students are required to have email delivery for Canvas announcements enabled. TBA

## Course Material

### Readings 

Several chapters from two textbooks (listed below) will be assigned as either required readings or substitute readings to the pre-class videos. Links to those chapters will be provided on the Canvas page. 

TBA

Students are not required to purchase a textbook for this course.  Other (optional) readings will also be posted on the course Canvas page.
