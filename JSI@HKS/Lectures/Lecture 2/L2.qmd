# Consumer Preferences and Constraints



## Today's Class


1. Discuss announcements; student feedback; reflection question discussion

2. Provide and overview of the consumer choice and public policy unit

3. Introduce a utility-based framework to model consume preferences

  - Utility function
  - Indifference curves; properties of the indifference curves 

## Consumer Choice and Public Policy

Consumers make choices by trying to select the best feasible option, given available information

Many of the choices consumers make can be modeled through optimization (i.e. rational, self-interested “homo economicus”)

Available information may be limited when there is some uncertainty. In such cases, people’s risk preferences will matter

Behavioral economics identifies specific situations in which people fail to optimize 
i.e., behavior inconsistent with optimization
