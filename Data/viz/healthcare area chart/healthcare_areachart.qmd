Note: The income measure used here is disposable income, which is defined as market income plus cash  transfers from the government and noncash benefits like food stamps and public housing. It excludes taxes, out-of-pocket medical spending, insurance premiums and other expenses. There have been small changes in the census questionnaire between the two survey dates.
