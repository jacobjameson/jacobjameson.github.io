The theme of this week's #TidyTuesday is "Bring your own data from 2022!"

| Week | Date | Data | Source | Article
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :---|
| 1 | `2023-01-03` | Bring your own data from 2022! | | |


I decided to use data from Tidy Tuesday 2022-07-05. Here is a little more information about the data:


# SF Rents

The data this week comes from [Kate Pennington](https://www.katepennington.org/data), [data.sfgov.org](https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Building-Permits/i98e-djp9/data), [Vital Signs](https://www.vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/housing-production).

If using Dr. Pennington's data, please cite:
