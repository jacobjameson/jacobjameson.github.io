Here is a little more information about the data:

# Big Tech Stock Prices

The data this week comes from Yahoo Finance via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/big-tech-stock-prices) (by [Evan Gower](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/509)).

> This dataset consists of the daily stock prices and volume of 14 different tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) and more!

A number of articles have examined the collapse of "Big Tech" stock prices, including [this article from morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1129535/5-charts-on-big-tech-stocks-collapse).

Note: All `stock_symbol`s have 3271 prices, except META (2688) and TSLA (3148) because they were not publicly traded for part of the period examined.
