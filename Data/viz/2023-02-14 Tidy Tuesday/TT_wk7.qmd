Here is a little more information about the data:
# Hollywood Age Gaps

The data this week comes from [Hollywood Age Gap](https://hollywoodagegap.com/) via [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-07-edition/).

> An informational site showing the age gap between movie love interests.

The data follows certain rules:

> The two (or more) actors play actual love interests (not just friends, coworkers, or some other non-romantic type of relationship)

> The youngest of the two actors is at least 17 years old

> Not animated characters

We previously provided a dataset about the [Bechdel Test](https://tidytues.day/2021/2021-03-09). It might be interesting to see whether there is any correlation between these datasets! The Bechdel Test dataset also included additional information about the films that were used in that dataset.

Note: The age gaps dataset includes "gender" columns, which always contain the values "man" or "woman". These values appear to indicate how the *characters* in each film identify. Some of these values do not match how the *actor* identifies. We apologize if any characters are misgendered in the data!
