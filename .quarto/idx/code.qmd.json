The goal is to introduce R programming concepts with a focus on preparing and analyzing data, and conducting statistical simulations. We will cover how to read data into R, manipulate data with a suite of tools from the tidyverse package dplyr. We will also discuss some basic programming concepts including data types and operators. This mini-course is aimed at people with no programming background that are looking for a gentle and practical introduction to data analysis in R.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"reference-location":"margin","css":["styles.css"],"from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"code.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","twitter-card":{"creator":"@JacobCJameson","image":"images/profile.png","card-style":"summary_large_image"},"toc-location":"left","anchor-sections":true,"fig-cap-location":"margin","footnotes-hover":true,"fontsize":"1em","theme":"spacelab","title":"Coding"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
