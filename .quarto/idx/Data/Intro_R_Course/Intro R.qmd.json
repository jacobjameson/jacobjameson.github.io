The goal is to introduce R programming concepts with a focus on preparing and analyzing data, and conducting statistical simulations. We will cover how to read data into R, manipulate data with a suite of tools from the tidyverse package dplyr. We will also discuss some basic programming concepts including data types and operators.\n\n\nThis mini-course is aimed at people with no programming background that are looking for a gentle and practical introduction to data analysis in R.\n\n\nEach Module involves:\n\n- a pre-recorded lecture with guided practice exercises\n- a corresponding lab to practice the skills taught in the video and stretch your thinking\n\n\nThe labs are an essential part of the learning process as they walkthrough the use of many key functions and topics that are not explicitly covered in the videos.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- Module 0: R and RStudio Installation Guide\n\n- Module 1: An Introduction and Motivation for R Programming\n\n- Module 2: Installing Packages and Reading Data\n\n- Module 3: Vectors and Lists\n\n- Module 4: Data Manipulation\n\n- Module 5: Data Manipulation and Analysis II\n\n- Module 6: Data Visualization as a Tool for Analysis\n\n- Module 7: Grouped Analysis\n\n- Module 8: Iteration\n\n- Module 9: Writing Functions\n\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold; color:#8B0000;\">Additional Resources</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/\">tidyverse cheetsheets</a> start with dplyr and ggplot</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://r4ds.had.co.nz\">R for Data Science</a>: free online book with clear explanations of many tidyverse functions, the book to read on data analysis with R</li>\n</ul>\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"reference-location":"margin","css":["../../styles.css"],"from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"Intro R.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","twitter-card":{"creator":"@JacobCJameson","image":"../../images/profile.png","card-style":"summary_large_image"},"toc-location":"left","anchor-sections":true,"fig-cap-location":"margin","footnotes-hover":true,"fontsize":"1em","theme":"spacelab","title":"Introduction to Programming in R","page-layout":"full"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
