I am currently advised by Dr. Soroush Saghafian and work in [The Public Impact Analytics Science Lab (PIAS-Lab)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/saghafian/public-impact-analytics-science-lab-pias-lab-harvard) at Harvard.\n\nI study the quantitative techniques that are used for informing decision-making at the individual and population levels, including decision analysis, risk analysis, cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis, disease and policy simulation modeling, and behavioral decision theory. My research aims to quantify trade offs of harms versus benefits to directly inform a decision being made under conditions of uncertainty.\n\n\nPrior to starting my PhD, I completed an M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at The University of Chicago. Before that, I was a middle school mathematics teacher in New Haven, CT. Aside from research I am very interested in K-12 computer science education. \n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"reference-location":"margin","css":["styles.css"],"from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","twitter-card":{"creator":"@JacobCJameson","image":"images/profile.png","card-style":"summary_large_image"},"toc-location":"left","anchor-sections":true,"fig-cap-location":"margin","footnotes-hover":true,"fontsize":"1em","theme":"spacelab","title":"Links","image":"images/profile.png","about":{"template":"solana","links":[{"icon":"envelope","text":"Email","href":"jacobjameson@g.harvard.edu"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/jacobjameson"},{"icon":"twitter","text":"Twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/JacobCJameson"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-jameson/"},{"icon":"mortarboard","text":"CV","href":"/Data/vitae.pdf"}]},"page-layout":"full"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
