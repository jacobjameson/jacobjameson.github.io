  <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>

I am a PhD student at Harvard University studying Health Policy and Decision Sciences. I am currently advised by Dr. Soroush Saghafian and work in [The Public Impact Analytics Science Lab (PIAS-Lab)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/saghafian/public-impact-analytics-science-lab-pias-lab-harvard) at Harvard.

I study the quantitative techniques that are used for informing decision-making at the individual and population levels, including decision analysis, risk analysis, cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis, disease and policy simulation modeling, and behavioral decision theory. My research aims to quantify tradeoffs of harms versus benefits to directly inform a decision being made under conditions of uncertainty.
