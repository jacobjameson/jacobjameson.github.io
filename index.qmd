## About Me

<div class="flex">
<p class="header-sub-title" id="word"></p>
<p class="header-sub-title blink">|</p>
</div>

I am a PhD student at Harvard University studying Health Policy and Decision Sciences. I am a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded Predoctoral Research Fellow in [Comparative Effectiveness Research for Suicide Prevention](https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/suicideprevention/) at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org).

[My research](research.qmd) develops and applies methods in causal inference, Bayesian statistics, and reinforcement learning to improve decision-making in health and public policy. I work at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and health policy, with applications to problems in suicide prevention, emergency department operations, and precision medicine. Methodologically, I focus on causal estimation in complex settings and sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but I am broadly interested in statistical computing, machine learning, and reproducible research.

Aside from research, I am passionate about teaching. I have [extensive experience teaching](teaching.qmd) students in a variety of settings, including as a teaching fellow at Harvard, instructor at UChicago Medicine, and as a Teach For America corps member in New Haven Public Schools.
