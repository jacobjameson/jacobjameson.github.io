Welcome!

I am a PhD student at Harvard University studying Health Policy and Decision Sciences. I am currently advised by Dr. Soroush Saghafian and work in [The Public Impact Analytics Science Lab (PIAS-Lab)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/saghafian/public-impact-analytics-science-lab-pias-lab-harvard) at Harvard.

I study the quantitative techniques that are used for informing decision-making at the individual and population levels, including decision analysis, risk analysis, cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis, disease and policy simulation modeling, and behavioral decision theory. My research aims to quantify trade offs of harms versus benefits to directly inform a decision being made under conditions of uncertainty.

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed an M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at The University of Chicago. Before that, I was a middle school mathematics teacher in New Haven, CT. Aside from research I am very interested in K-12 computer science education.
