We will go through the interface of R Studio to better understand the environment and learn how to do simple variable assignment, arithmetic, and logical comparison. \nauthor: Jacob Jameson\n---\n\n\n## An Introduction and Motivation for R Programming\n\n[Download a copy of Module 1 slides](slides1.html)\n\n\n\n<center> \n<iframe width=\"700\" height=\"500\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_JdkNuuhms\">\n</iframe>\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n## Lab 1\n\nWe expect you to watch the Module 1 material prior to lab.\n\n### General Guidelines:\n\nYou will encounter a few functions we did not cover in the lecture video. This will give you some practice on how to use a new function for the first time. You can try following steps:\n\n1. Start by typing `?new_function` in your Console to open up the help page\n2. Read the help page of this `new_function`. The description might be too technical for now. Thatâ€™s OK. Pay attention to the Usage and Arguments, especially the argument `x` or `x`,`y` (when two arguments are required)\n3. At the bottom of the help page, there are a few examples. Run the first few lines to see how it works\n4. Apply it in your lab questions\n\n**It is highly likely that you will encounter error messages while doing this lab Here are a few steps that might help get you through it.**\n\n1. Locate which line is causing this error first\n2. Check if you may have a typo in the code. Sometimes another person can spot a typo faster than you.\n3. If you enter the code without any typo, try googling the error message\n4. Scroll through the top few links see if any of them helps\n\n\n\n### Warm-up\n\n1. The most important warm up question: do you have R and RStudio installed?\n\n\n\n2. Which of these allow you to pull up the documentation for a command in R?\n\n  (a) `*`\n  (b) `?`\n  (c) `help()`\n  (d) `documentation()`\n\n\n3. In the code block below, run code that will pull up documentation for the function `paste0()`.\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?paste0()\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat does this function do?\n\n\n4. What are the two ways that you can assign a value to a variable?\n\n### Guess the Output: Algebra \n\n5. Guess the output of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- 3\nb <- a^2 + 1\n\nb\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, run the code block to check your answer.\n\n\n\n6. Guess the output of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- 10\nb <-3 %% a\n\nb + 5\n```\n:::\n\n\n*Hint*: If you are not sure what `%%` does you can try running `?'%%'` to better understand. \n\n\n7. Guess the output of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- c(1,2,3)\nb <- a^2 + 1\n\nb\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Guess the Output: Boolean \n\n\n8. Guess the output of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n25 >= 14\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n9. Guess the output of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n10 != 100\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n10. Guess the output of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n7%%5 == 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n11. Guess the output of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(5 > 7) & (7 * 7 == 49)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n12. Ok, let's try some logic! Try to figure out each one before running the code!\n\n(a)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTRUE & FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nFALSE & FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTRUE | (FALSE & TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nFALSE | (TRUE | FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(TRUE & (TRUE | FALSE)) | FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Data Types\n\n13. Run these lines to create these variables in your environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nitem_1 <- \"Hi, my name is item 1!\"\nitem_2 <- 7\nitem_3 <- FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat are the type (or mode) of each of these items?\n\n\n*Hint*: If you are not sure, you could apply the `mode()` function to each item and check the output. If you are unsure about how to apply the `mode()` function, you can always run `?mode()`.\n\n\n14. Guess the output of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(item_2 + 19 <= 25) == item_3\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n15. Do you remember earlier when you ran `?paste0()`? We are now going to try to use this function. In the code block below, initialize two variables that are of mode \"character\". The output when you apply `paste0()` to these variables should be \"Hello, world!\".\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#v1 <-\n#v2 <- \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWell done! You've learned how to work with R to perform simple variable assignment and operations!\n\n\n**Want to improve this tutorial?** Report any suggestions/bugs/improvements on  [here](mailto:jacobjameson@g.harvard.edu)!
