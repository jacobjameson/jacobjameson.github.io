This post uses visualization as a tool to explain how different measures of centrality may be used to analyze different questions in a network analysis. In these examples we will be specifically looking at directed graphs to compare the following centrality measures and their use-cases:\n\nDegree Centrality\nBetweenness Centrality\nEigenvector Centrality\nKatz Centrality\nHITS Hubs and Authorities\n\nAn example of a directed graph would be one in which people nominate their top 2 friends. In this graph, nodes (people) would connect to others nodes through directed edges (nominations). It is possible for Jacob to nominate Jenna without Jenna nominating him back. You can imagine why centrality in a friendship network might take into account the direction of these nominations. If I list 100 people as my friends and none of them list me back, do we think I am a popular person?"

When we sum up all connections of a node, not all neighbors are equally important. This is a very interesting way to measure popularity in our classroom where we say the popularity of your friends matters more than the number of friends. Let‚Äôs consider two nodes in a friend network with same degree, the one who is connected to more central nodes should be more central.\nFirst, we define an initial guess for the centrality of nodes in a graph as \\(x_i=1\\). Now we are going to iterate for the new centrality value \\(x_i'\\) for node \\(i\\) as following:\n\\[x_i' = \\sum_{j} A_{ij}x_j\\]\nHere \\(A_{ij}\\) is an element of the adjacency matrix, where it gives 1 or 0 for whether an edge exists between nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). it can also be written in matrix notation as \\(\\mathbf{x'} = \\mathbf{Ax}\\).\nWe iterate over t steps to find the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\) as:\n\\[\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{A^t x}(0)\\]\n\npar(bg=\"grey98\")\nplot(network, layout=lay, \n     vertex.label.dist=1.5, vertex.label.color = \"black\", edge.color=\"grey80\",\n     vertex.size=evcent(network)$vector*15,   # Rescaled by multiplying by 15\n     main=\"Eigenvector Centrality\", vertex.color=\"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows, the students which have the same number of friend nominations are not necessarily in the same size. The one that is connected to more central, or ‚Äúpopular‚Äù nodes are larger in this visualization.\nHowever, as we can see from the definition, this can be a problematic measure for directed graphs. Let‚Äôs say that a student who received no friend nominations themselves nominates another student as a friend. Because that person has 0 friend nominations themselves, they would not contribute any importance to the person they nominated. In other words, eigenvector centrality would not take zero in-degree nodes into account in directed graphs.\nHowever there is a solution to this!"

In order to find out such nodes, the HITS algorithm introduces two types of central nodes: Hubs and Authorities. For Hubs, we might consider a node important if it links to many highly nominated nodes (i.e.¬†the person nominates many popular people as their friends). For Authorities, we might consider a node to be of importance if many highly nominated nodes link to it (i.e.¬†nominated by many popular people).\nAuthority Centrality is defined as the sum of the hub centralities which point to the node (i):\n\\[x_i = \\alpha \\sum_{j} A_{ij} y_j,\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is constant. Likewise, Hub Centrality is the sum of the authorities which are pointed by the node \\(i\\):\n\\[y_i = \\beta \\sum_{j} A_{ji} x_j,\\]\nwith constant \\(\\beta\\). Here notice that the element of the adjacency matrix are swapped for Hub Centrality because we are concerned with outgoing edges for hubs. So in matrix notation:\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = \\alpha \\mathbf{Ay}, \\quad\\]\n\\[\\mathbf{y} = \\beta \\mathbf{A^Tx}.\\] As it can be seen from the drawing, HITS Algorithm also tackles the problem with zero in-degree nodes of Eigenvector Centrality. These zero in-degree nodes become central hubs and contribute to other nodes. Yet we can still use a free centrality contribution constant like in Katz Centrality or other variants.\nAlthough these measures are generally used in a citation network or the internet, this can be pretty interesting in the context of our classroom frienship network. Maybe we are interested in knowing who are the non-popular students that nominate many popular students as friends, but receive no reciprocity in terms of nominations."
