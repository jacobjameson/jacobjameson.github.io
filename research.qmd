<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The introduction of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has markedly improved outcomes for advanced melanoma. However, many patients develop resistance through unknown mechanisms. While combination ICB has improved response rate and progression-free survival, it substantially increases toxicity. Biomarkers to distinguish patients who would benefit from combination therapy versus aPD-1 remain elusive. We analyzed whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment tumors from four cohorts (n = 140) of ICB-na√Øve patients treated with aPD-1. High genomic heterogeneity and low ploidy robustly identified patients intrinsically resistant to aPD-1. To establish clinically actionable predictions, we optimized and validated a predictive model using ploidy and heterogeneity to confidently identify (90% PPV) patients with intrinsic resistance to and worse survival on aPD-1. We further observed that three of seven (43%) patients predicted to be intrinsically resistant to single-agent PD-1 ICB responded to combination ICB, suggesting that these patients may benefit disproportionately from combination ICB. These findings highlight the importance of heterogeneity and ploidy, nominating an approach toward clinical actionability.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><strong>Importance:</strong> Male gender expressivity (MGE), reflecting sociocultural masculinity norms, may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To examine associations between adolescent and young adult MGE and CVD risk diagnoses and treatment in men.</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> A cohort study of 4,230 U.S. males (aged 12-18 years in adolescence, followed into adulthood) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health).</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Higher MGE in adolescence and young adulthood was linked to lower rates of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnoses, as well as less hypertension and diabetes treatment in adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Elevated MGE in youth may reduce adult CVD risk and treatment, highlighting the need for tailored public health strategies to address distinctive risks in males with high MGE.</p>
